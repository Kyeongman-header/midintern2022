"So many times have I walked on ruins , the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared , each time I could feel my city , my current generation collapse , break into the black hole that thrives within it , I could feel humanity , the way I 'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years , the pattern became obvious , no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly .  It 's funny , but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long , what I have lived for my entire life , only then , when I achieved immortality I started truly aging .   5 world wars have passed , and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often , I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own , the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells ; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced , a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times , a mechanism that when lost all of which it had , had me loosing my will to live , for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence .   Acceptance , something so important . a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times , an ability that looks so easy to achieve , a gift , that I was n't able to aquire in all my years , until now . When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity 's fall , I felt as if all of it 's weight was crushing me . Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope , a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years , the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was .   If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy , it can..  I ca n't feel my legs , I have walked for days , just to hear the sound of gravel , crushed bones , crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered , the day in my far past . The day of my rebirth , I took out of my pocket a small plastic box , with nine buttons and a small glass window . I could n't believe this was our past , I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet , be destroyed by our own violence .  I slowly dialed the number I was given , exactly 1729 years ago .   I dropped a tear , a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me .   A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me , I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack ...   `` You have finally arrived '' He projected into my mind , with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice .   `` I 'm ready to obey '' I answered . I knew who was sitting infront of me , and it was time for me to obey him , after all these years of playing god , even I came to it .   Funny is n't it ? Even by achieving immortality , death , is inescapable .","After a few hundred years, the pattern became obvious, no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly.

"`` Walker pressed his hand against the machine he had grown so fond of one final time , as the pain in his side grew stronger .

He 'd never written something so beautiful in his life . When he 'd started the story , he never thought he 'd find the proper way to end it .

"Leni relaxed back against a wall . It was almost over . Give him a few more minutes and she would no longer have to glorify someone that publicly ordered a lynching of many of her employees .   `` SIEG HEIL ! SIEG HEIL ! '' She heard . An old woman looked up at the great dictator with elation , her hand so high in the air it could have crashed an airship . This smile turned to a scowl as she noticed Leni Riefenstahl was not participating in the salute . Not wanting a shot of the crowd to be ruined by one angry looking woman , Leni smiled at her and motioned to the camera . She then constructed a screen with her fingers and directed them towards the woman . The woman 's face again changed , she pulled her scowl into a slight smirk , as though she was trying to hide it and she resumed her posing .   Leni took off her hat , she thought to herself that this man might just be the death of her , and she prayed that the paycheck might just be worth dying for . She played with her hair and jolted around as she heard something . Nobody else but her and the sound guy noticed it , but then it began to amplify . From a whisper , to louder than Adolf 's insesent screaming .   `` What what ? What ? What ?

"So many times have I walked on ruins , the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared , each time I could feel my city , my current generation collapse , break into the black hole that thrives within it , I could feel humanity , the way I 'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years , the pattern became obvious , no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly .  It 's funny , but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long , what I have lived for my entire life , only then , when I achieved immortality I started truly aging .   5 world wars have passed , and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often , I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own , the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells ; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced , a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times , a mechanism that when lost all of which it had , had me loosing my will to live , for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence .   Acceptance , something so important . a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times , an ability that looks so easy to achieve , a gift , that I was n't able to aquire in all my years , until now . When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity 's fall , I felt as if all of it 's weight was crushing me . Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope , a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years , the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was .   If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy , it can..  I ca n't feel my legs , I have walked for days , just to hear the sound of gravel , crushed bones , crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered , the day in my far past . The day of my rebirth , I took out of my pocket a small plastic box , with nine buttons and a small glass window . I could n't believe this was our past , I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet , be destroyed by our own violence .  I slowly dialed the number I was given , exactly 1729 years ago .   I dropped a tear , a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me .   A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me , I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack ...   `` You have finally arrived '' He projected into my mind , with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice .   `` I 'm ready to obey '' I answered . I knew who was sitting infront of me , and it was time for me to obey him , after all these years of playing god , even I came to it .   Funny is n't it ? Even by achieving immortality , death , is inescapable .","After a few hundred years, the pattern became obvious, no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly.

Give him a few more minutes and she would no longer have to glorify someone that publicly ordered a lynching of many of her employees .   `` SIEG HEIL ! SIEG HEIL ! '' She heard . An old woman looked up at the great dictator with elation , her hand so high in the air it could have crashed an airship . This smile turned to a scowl as she noticed Leni Riefenstahl was not participating in the salute . Not wanting a shot of the crowd to be ruined by one angry looking woman , Leni smiled at her and motioned to the camera . She then constructed a screen with her fingers and directed them towards the woman . The woman 's face again changed , she pulled her scowl into a slight smirk , as though she was trying to hide it and she resumed her posing .   Leni took off her hat , she thought to herself that this man might just be the death of her , and she prayed that the paycheck might just be worth dying for . She played with her hair and jolted around as she heard something . Nobody else but her and the sound guy noticed it , but then it began to amplify . From a whisper , to louder than Adolf 's insesent screaming .   `` What what ? What ? What ?

"So many times have I walked on ruins , the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared , each time I could feel my city , my current generation collapse , break into the black hole that thrives within it , I could feel humanity , the way I 'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years , the pattern became obvious , no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly .  It 's funny , but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long , what I have lived for my entire life , only then , when I achieved immortality I started truly aging .   5 world wars have passed , and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often , I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own , the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells ; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced , a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times , a mechanism that when lost all of which it had , had me loosing my will to live , for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence .   Acceptance , something so important . a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times , an ability that looks so easy to achieve , a gift , that I was n't able to aquire in all my years , until now . When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity 's fall , I felt as if all of it 's weight was crushing me . Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope , a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years , the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was .   If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy , it can..  I ca n't feel my legs , I have walked for days , just to hear the sound of gravel , crushed bones , crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered , the day in my far past . The day of my rebirth , I took out of my pocket a small plastic box , with nine buttons and a small glass window . I could n't believe this was our past , I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet , be destroyed by our own violence .  I slowly dialed the number I was given , exactly 1729 years ago .   I dropped a tear , a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me .   A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me , I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack ...   `` You have finally arrived '' He projected into my mind , with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice .   `` I 'm ready to obey '' I answered . I knew who was sitting infront of me , and it was time for me to obey him , after all these years of playing god , even I came to it .   Funny is n't it ? Even by achieving immortality , death , is inescapable .","After a few hundred years, the pattern became obvious, no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly.

Not wanting a shot of the crowd to be ruined by one angry looking woman , Leni smiled at her and motioned to the camera .

The woman 's face again changed , she pulled her scowl into a slight smirk , as though she was trying to hide it and she resumed her posing .

The day of my rebirth , I took out of my pocket a small plastic box , with nine buttons and a small glass window . I could n't believe this was our past , I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet , be destroyed by our own violence .  I slowly dialed the number I was given , exactly 1729 years ago .   I dropped a tear , a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me .   A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me , I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack ...   `` You have finally arrived '' He projected into my mind , with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice .   `` I 'm ready to obey '' I answered .

"So many times have I walked on ruins , the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared , each time I could feel my city , my current generation collapse , break into the black hole that thrives within it , I could feel humanity , the way I 'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years , the pattern became obvious , no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly .  It 's funny , but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long , what I have lived for my entire life , only then , when I achieved immortality I started truly aging .   5 world wars have passed , and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often , I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own , the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells ; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced , a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times , a mechanism that when lost all of which it had , had me loosing my will to live , for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence .   Acceptance , something so important . a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times , an ability that looks so easy to achieve , a gift , that I was n't able to aquire in all my years , until now . When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity 's fall , I felt as if all of it 's weight was crushing me . Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope , a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years , the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was .   If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy , it can..  I ca n't feel my legs , I have walked for days , just to hear the sound of gravel , crushed bones , crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered , the day in my far past . The day of my rebirth , I took out of my pocket a small plastic box , with nine buttons and a small glass window . I could n't believe this was our past , I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet , be destroyed by our own violence .  I slowly dialed the number I was given , exactly 1729 years ago .   I dropped a tear , a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me .   A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me , I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack ...   `` You have finally arrived '' He projected into my mind , with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice .   `` I 'm ready to obey '' I answered . I knew who was sitting infront of me , and it was time for me to obey him , after all these years of playing god , even I came to it .   Funny is n't it ? Even by achieving immortality , death , is inescapable .","After a few hundred years, the pattern became obvious, no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly.

"So many times have I walked on ruins , the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared , each time I could feel my city , my current generation collapse , break into the black hole that thrives within it , I could feel humanity , the way I 'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years , the pattern became obvious , no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly .  It 's funny , but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long , what I have lived for my entire life , only then , when I achieved immortality I started truly aging .   5 world wars have passed , and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often , I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own , the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells ; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced , a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times , a mechanism that when lost all of which it had , had me loosing my will to live , for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence .   Acceptance , something so important . a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times , an ability that looks so easy to achieve , a gift , that I was n't able to aquire in all my years , until now . When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity 's fall , I felt as if all of it 's weight was crushing me . Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope , a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years , the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was .   If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy , it can..  I ca n't feel my legs , I have walked for days , just to hear the sound of gravel , crushed bones , crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered , the day in my far past . The day of my rebirth , I took out of my pocket a small plastic box , with nine buttons and a small glass window . I could n't believe this was our past , I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet , be destroyed by our own violence .  I slowly dialed the number I was given , exactly 1729 years ago .   I dropped a tear , a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me .   A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me , I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack ...   `` You have finally arrived '' He projected into my mind , with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice .   `` I 'm ready to obey '' I answered . I knew who was sitting infront of me , and it was time for me to obey him , after all these years of playing god , even I came to it .   Funny is n't it ?

Not wanting a shot of the crowd to be ruined by one angry looking woman , Leni smiled at her and motioned to the camera .

"So many times have I walked on ruins , the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared , each time I could feel my city , my current generation collapse , break into the black hole that thrives within it , I could feel humanity , the way I 'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years , the pattern became obvious , no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly .  It 's funny , but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long , what I have lived for my entire life , only then , when I achieved immortality I started truly aging .   5 world wars have passed , and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often , I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own , the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells ; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced , a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times , a mechanism that when lost all of which it had , had me loosing my will to live , for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence .   Acceptance , something so important . a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times , an ability that looks so easy to achieve , a gift , that I was n't able to aquire in all my years , until now . When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity 's fall , I felt as if all of it 's weight was crushing me . Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope , a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years , the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was .   If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy , it can..  I ca n't feel my legs , I have walked for days , just to hear the sound of gravel , crushed bones , crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered , the day in my far past . The day of my rebirth , I took out of my pocket a small plastic box , with nine buttons and a small glass window . I could n't believe this was our past , I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet , be destroyed by our own violence .  I slowly dialed the number I was given , exactly 1729 years ago .   I dropped a tear , a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me .   A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me , I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack ...   `` You have finally arrived '' He projected into my mind , with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice .   `` I 'm ready to obey '' I answered . I knew who was sitting infront of me , and it was time for me to obey him , after all these years of playing god , even I came to it .   Funny is n't it ?

One of the teachers from another state had taken on a special project to the class , writing a paper about an ancient fable that hung in the hallway . He had spent the weekend weaving through the streets with it , scrawled out in the margins with red felt wed to the tops , so when he did n't get paid and had to work early in the morning he and his co-workers turned to one another and said ,   `` I wish I had a fable to speak of with Marissa .

"Leni relaxed back against a wall . It was almost over . Give him a few more minutes and she would no longer have to glorify someone that publicly ordered a lynching of many of her employees .   `` SIEG HEIL ! SIEG HEIL ! '' She heard . An old woman looked up at the great dictator with elation , her hand so high in the air it could have crashed an airship . This smile turned to a scowl as she noticed Leni Riefenstahl was not participating in the salute . Not wanting a shot of the crowd to be ruined by one angry looking woman , Leni smiled at her and motioned to the camera . She then constructed a screen with her fingers and directed them towards the woman . The woman 's face again changed , she pulled her scowl into a slight smirk , as though she was trying to hide it and she resumed her posing .   Leni took off her hat , she thought to herself that this man might just be the death of her , and she prayed that the paycheck might just be worth dying for . She played with her hair and jolted around as she heard something . Nobody else but her and the sound guy noticed it , but then it began to amplify . From a whisper , to louder than Adolf 's insesent screaming .   `` What what ? What ? What ?

"So many times have I walked on ruins , the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared , each time I could feel my city , my current generation collapse , break into the black hole that thrives within it , I could feel humanity , the way I 'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years , the pattern became obvious , no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly .  It 's funny , but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long , what I have lived for my entire life , only then , when I achieved immortality I started truly aging .   5 world wars have passed , and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often , I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own , the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells ; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced , a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times , a mechanism that when lost all of which it had , had me loosing my will to live , for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence .   Acceptance , something so important . a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times , an ability that looks so easy to achieve , a gift , that I was n't able to aquire in all my years , until now . When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity 's fall , I felt as if all of it 's weight was crushing me . Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope , a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years , the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was .   If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy , it can..  I ca n't feel my legs , I have walked for days , just to hear the sound of gravel , crushed bones , crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered , the day in my far past . The day of my rebirth , I took out of my pocket a small plastic box , with nine buttons and a small glass window . I could n't believe this was our past , I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet , be destroyed by our own violence .  I slowly dialed the number I was given , exactly 1729 years ago .   I dropped a tear , a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me .   A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me , I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack ...   `` You have finally arrived '' He projected into my mind , with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice .   `` I 'm ready to obey '' I answered . I knew who was sitting infront of me , and it was time for me to obey him , after all these years of playing god , even I came to it .   Funny is n't it ?

You may understand the theory behind it , may even understand why it works , but no amount of study can prepare you for the real thing .   They always tell you to say goodbye before you go , but fewer than half actually do . Why say goodbye when you can go back and do it again and again ? Say goodbye . Is n't that what everyone had always said ? Say yes and you 'll be back . Say it again . Is that what you really meant when you said you 'd never go back ?   The other half of the argument is that you 've already changed your mind"
