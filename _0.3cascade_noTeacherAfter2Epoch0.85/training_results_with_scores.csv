"The death of a high-profile mystery shopper known as 'the master of disguise' has sent shivers through the tight-knit world of mystery shoppers and led some to speculate that she was attacked because of her work. Marjorie Hillerman, 61, was found December 9 in the parking lot of Livermore Premium Outlets in northern California with a severe head wound. She died a week later. Police are baffled by her death. The injuries to her face and head suggest she could have fallen. However, the wounds could have been delivered by an attacker. At least one friend fears she was murdered. Scroll down for video. Victim: Marjorie Hillerman's injuries were revealed while she was in a parking lot for the Livermore Premium Outlets on December 9. The Independent Mystery Shoppers Coalition, a trade group that represents people who pose as customers to evaluate customer service at stores and restaurants, has warned its members to be on guard and wary of attack, the San Jose Mercury-News reports. 'We don't believe she just fell. She wasn't that type of person. She was just too on top of things,' Pamela Olmstead, president of the Independent Mystery Shoppers Coalition and a friend of Hillerman, told the newspaper. 'It has frozen our community. That's the impact she had on us.' Hillerman was well-known among mystery shopper and had a reputation for being able to quickly change her appearance so that store clerks wouldn't recognize her. No one saw what happened that day, and no CCTV tape is available, the website reported. Police told the website that it does not appear a robbery took place. Friend: Pamela Olmstead, a friend of Marjorie Hillerman, has said Hillerman was known as 'the master of disguise' Speaking about the investigation, Officer Steve Goard told Bay Area News Group 'It's been a struggle. It could have been a fall or an assault; it could be any number of things....It's baffling.' 'There's nothing that leads us in any one direction,' he also said. Goard also told the media outlet that it doesn't seem the 61-year-old Hillerman got inside Livermore Premium Outlets whatsoever. She had all of her items and her rental car was unharmed, he also said. In a release issued earlier this month, Livermore police said 'We received information from the public regarding a white 4-door sedan that was seen leaving the area around the same time as the incident.' Hillerman's friend Pamela Olmstead of the Independent Mystery Shoppers Coalition told Bay Area News Group that Hillerman often spoke at conferences for the mystery shopper industry. Olmstead also stated that the upcoming conference will include safety instruction. Bizarre: No one saw what happened that day at the outlet mall, and no CCTV tape is available. Speaking to NBC Bay Area, Olmstead said 'What I fear happened is that either someone wanted something she had, or they hit her with a car and left out of fear.' 'It's my hope somebody's going to be watching this and say ""Hey, I saw that incident, I saw what happened"" and come forth and tell somebody so we can find out what happened,' Olmstead also said. Speaking about her friend's nickname, Olmstead told NBC Bay Area 'Margie could go from being a brunette to a blonde to blackhead to long hair, wearing jeans to wearing a skirt in a matter of seconds.'

"By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 12:13 EST, 8 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 14:24 EST, 8 January 2014. A cancer research pioneer used computer software to spy on his ex-wife as they went through a bitter divorce, prosecutors have said. Dr Steven Curley, 57, from Missouri City near Houston, Texas, faces 20 years in prison if convicted of the charge of unlawful intercept. He allegedly plotted with a computer expert, Hand Lehmann, to install a tracking program called eBlaster, which records passwords, online conversations, keystrokes and webpage use. Arrest: Dr Steven Curley has been charged with unlawful intercept after allegedly using spying software to monitor his ex-wife online. He is pictured left in his mug shot and right in an interview in 2007. Targeted: He allegedly used the software to spy on his ex-wife, Karen, after their failed two-year marriage. The popular program, which costs $100, is used by parents to track their children's internet use, by employers to watch their workers and by spouses checking for cheating partners, KHOU reported. Curley allegedly used the program to. spy on his wife Karen, a physician's assistant, as they divorced after. just two years of marriage. System: He allegedly used eBlaster, which records key strokes and internet use. The couple had once worked together at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Curley’s attorney, Robert Scardino, says he believes a bitter divorce is behind the accusations and that once further information comes to light, 'he'll be vindicated'. 'He’s very concerned that something like. this could have an adverse effect on his career,' Scardino told KHOU. 'It’s certainly a. distraction from what he does.' Dr Curley, a Professor of Surgical Oncology, worked at MD Anderson to develop new ways of beating hard-to-treat cancers using radio waves. In October, a report announced he had just been named chief of surgical oncology at the Dan L. Duncan Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. MD Anderson said he left the hospital at the end of 2013. The spying program, eBlaster, is virtually undetectable after it has been put in a system, and once in place, it can capture activity on a computer and send details to an email address. Sidney May from the Spy Emporium in Montrose told KHOU: 'We have customers that come back and buy multiple copies because they want to spy on the laptop and the desktop.' Tracked: Curley's lawyer said once the details of his divorce with ex-wife Karen (pictured) become public, his client will be vindicated. It is legal for parents to use the software for their children's internet use, as well as employers and educators, although monitoring personal email remains a gray area.

Teachers have apologised to parents after a group of primary school children were forced to stay in the canteen until they had finished all the food on their plates. Parents of children attending Kaizen Primary School in Plaistow, East London, were left fuming after a group of pupils, some as young as five, were told they had to clear their plates before being allowed out into the playground. Even though years ago parents would not have batted an eyelid and would have welcomed schools encouraging their children to eat, dozens of parents complained, saying that children should 'not be forced to eat' by teachers. Upset: Parents of children at Kaizen Primary School in Plaistow, East London, said pupils were told they had to clear their plates (file picture) Candeece Kenlock said her five-year-old son Kehyan was'so scared' of being forced to eat everything on his plate he didn't want to go to school anymore. She said: 'He was crying and saying that the kids couldn't scrape any food into the bin. 'I've been finding food hidden down the table and in tissues at home. It's like he's picked up habits from school.' Another mother, who wanted only to be known as Jo, said she was now making packed lunches for her two sons so they didn't have to eat school dinners. She said: 'My boys came home in tears because they were forced to eat all their peas. 'All the parents have been talking about it. It's like going back to the dark ages.' Headteachers at Kaizen Primary School (pictured) have apologised and said the incident was a 'one-off' following concerns the children hadn't eaten enough. Another mother who did not want to be named, said: 'They really should not be forcing children to eat everything on their plate. 'If a child is full or really doesn't want to finish their school dinner they should be allowed to leave the food and go an play, not be told to clear their plate and being effectively locked in the canteen.' The two headteachers of the 440-pupil school, Rebekah Iiyambo and Mitch Karunaratne, have reassured parents that the teacher in question had been spoken to and have promised it 'won't happen again'. In a statement from the school they stated: 'There was a one-off incident where a member of staff kept a small number of pupils in the dining hall because they were concerned the children in question had not eaten enough of their school lunch to sustain them throughout the day.

"An Islamic terrorist has stopped Britain deporting him – by refusing to give his name for 21 years. A judge ruled that the Algerian is a ‘trusted and senior’ member of a violent terrorist group and has helped suspects abroad. But his lawyers have used human rights laws to prevent the Government from throwing him out of this country. Officials cannot draw up crucial paperwork guaranteeing his safety without knowing his true identity. Scroll down for video. 'Running rings round deportation laws': The Algerian has relied on human rights laws to stay in the UK. Pictured is the European Court of Human Right. Meanwhile, taxpayers have been left to pick up the multi-million pound bill for his legal aid and months of NHS hospital care. Astonishingly, the terrorist, known only as B, is free to walk the streets because his bail conditions were ‘relaxed’ to allow him to go swimming and worship at a mosque. The legal stand-off provoked a furious response from a senior Tory who branded human rights laws ‘a farce.’ Dominic Raab, MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘It is a damning indictment of the human rights farce in this country that this man has been able to run rings around the deportation system. 'Damning': Conservative MP Dominic Raab. ‘If a dangerous criminal or suspected terrorist can frustrate deportation, by spewing out human rights objections while refusing to give his name so the claims can be checked, it turns the system on its head. ‘Even the human rights lawyers should be embarrassed, it’s so ridiculous.’ The saga emerged in a recent court ruling when B tried to halt deportation proceedings. But judges struck out his appeal. His lawyers had said the failure to resolve the stand-off was a breach of his human right to an ‘effective remedy’ by the State to his legal limbo. But the judges criticised the failure of the mystery man to identify himself as a ‘deliberate distortion of the evidence’. They said his ‘manipulation of information, his contempt and abuse of process’ must not succeed because it would encourage others to ‘behave in a similar way’. The terrorist arrived illegally in Britain in 1993. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission found he bought a satellite phone and airtime for extremists in Algeria and Chechnya in 2000. The terrorist originally gave his name as Nolidoni, later claiming to be Pierre Dumond. Both identities were false. He then refused to identify himself, as his lawyers cited two sections of the European Convention on Human Rights. They said revealing who he is would put his family in Algeria in danger, a breach of article eight, and he could be at risk of torture, a breach of article three. In response, the Government spent huge sums trying to independently establish his identity with a global investigation. His fingerprints and DNA were taken but the Algerian authorities, as well as international counter-terrorism agencies, were unable to find a match. An Algerian language expert was employed to study his speech to pinpoint where he was from. Officials were even sent to Canada to speak to a fellow Algerian whose identity he stole after obtaining his passport. But no progress has been made. One source close to the case said: ‘He has admitted the name he was using is not his real name and the Algerians confirmed this. ‘Because of this the Government cannot obtain the individual assurances needed to secure his removal. It is not possible to deport him without these assurances because of our international human rights obligations.’ The terrorist is now on bail, with a nine-hour curfew and is banned from leaving a defined area without giving prior notice. He is also banned from meeting a list of</s>",Judge ruled Algerian man is 'trusted and senior' member of violent group. But lawyers used human rights laws to stop him being thrown out.

Campbell Dawson, 16, spent five weeks in ICU at Brisbane's Prince of Alexandria hospital. Campbell finally got of out hospital two weeks ago but now faces months of rehabilitation and a lifetime of help and therapy due to the severity of his injuries. Mum Donna, 41, has given up her job as an educator at the Brisbane School of Hairdressing to help care for her son. 'Every day is hard, a challenge and we're just living one day a time at the moment,' she says. Campbell currently needs assistance bathing and dressing, moving in and around his bed and transferring in and out of his wheelchair, as well as crucial equipment such as hoists and a shower seat. But because his family are not Australian citizens, they don't qualify for many of the benefits available in Australia, such as carer's allowance and money needed for vital equipment. As a result Variety Queensland and the MASKS Foundation have stepped in and have so far managed to provide Campbell with approximately $50,000 worth of equipment such as an $8,000 wheelchair, $12,000 power-assist wheels and a special $20,000 clip that changes the chair from manual to electric. Campbell's father, Jared, 45, the CFO at Brisbane Girls Grammar School, told the Daily Mail Australia: 'It's overwhelming how much support we've had from Variety and the MASKS foundation. 'Being New Zealand citizens we don't qualify for some of the funding and support, like carer's allowance, whereas an Australian citizen would. 'The funding from Variety and the MASK Foundation has enabled Campbell to have a wheelchair and we're getting some power-assist wheels, which means that when he pushes them they move a bit further and a clip that turns his wheelchair into an electric one. The Dawsons before the accident: Campbell, right, poses with his brother, Jayden, mum Donna and dad Jared. 'It's still early days and obviously his needs are constantly changing but at the moment they're helping with equipment and what comes next with physio and rehabilitation. The family, who moved to Australia in 2012 for Jared's work, hope to buy a house in the near future, but will need help with funding to modify it to Campbell's requirements, possibly even requiring a lift. 'We're still in the process of confirming exactly what equipment Campbell needs as the accident is so recent,' say Variety Queensland spokeswoman Penny Cameron. 'We're working closely with his therapists who have explained that his equipment requirements change very frequently.'

"Grenoble, France (CNN) -- Former Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher, who suffered a serious head injury in a skiing accident, is showing a ""slight improvement"" in his condition, doctors in France said Tuesday. On Monday night, doctors carried out a surgical intervention on Schumacher that allowed for some pressure to be relieved on his brain in a way that was ""gradual and effective,"" said Jean-Francois Payen, head of anesthesiology at the University Hospital Center of Grenoble. The surgery, which took about two hours, involved the removal of a large hematoma, he said. Schumacher remains in a medically induced coma. ""The situation is better under control than yesterday,"" Payen told reporters. ""We cannot say that he is out of danger, but we've gained a little time in his development. But the hours to come are hours that are crucial in our strategy."" The surgery came after a scan showed a surprising improvement in Schumacher's condition Monday afternoon, Payen said. After consulting with the driver's family, Schumacher's doctors decided to seize the ""window of opportunity"" and operate, he said. But Payen warned that it was too soon to speculate on Schumacher's prognosis. ""There is still a long way to go,"" he said. The driver is still in too fragile a state to be moved to another hospital. Schumacher, the most successful driver in Formula 1 history, suffered severe head trauma after falling while skiing Sunday in Meribel, in the French Alps. 'Catapulted onto his head' His manager, Sabine Kehm, recounted more details Tuesday of how the accident happened, gleaned from friends and family members who were present at the time. The party was skiing in an area of deep snow when Schumacher helped a friend who had fallen, she said. As he set off again and went to make a turn, he seems to have hit a rock hidden under the snow. This catapulted him into the air and he fell head down with all his weight onto another rock, she said, resulting in severe injuries to his head. Schumacher was not traveling fast at the time, Kehm said, so those with him were initially shocked by how badly he was hurt. ""It's not a question of speed but of the angle that you hit the rock,"" she said. Kehm also cautioned against reading too much into the doctors' latest report. ""They made it very clear that they are not optimistic, that... there was a slight improvement compared to the situation yesterday, which doesn't mean we can be optimistic yet,"" she said. ""It's much too early to say."" Kehm declined to comment on the emotional state of Schumacher's family. But she said ""heartwarming"" messages of support have come flooding in via e-mails, text messages and letters from people around the world. In a statement released Tuesday, Schumacher's family expressed thanks for the outpouring. ""They are giving us great support. We all know he is a fighter and will not give up,"" the statement said. Kehm said a journalist tried to sneak into Schumacher's hospital room disguised as a priest. World titles. The accident happened while Schumacher was off-piste -- meaning he was on unmarked slopes -- in the mountains between Georges Bauduis Piste and La Biche Piste, resort director Christophe Gernignon-Lecomte said. The driver was wearing a helmet at the time.

"By. Hugo Duncan. PUBLISHED:. 06:08 EST, 29 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:28 EST, 29 May 2013. The British economy will perform better than all its major European rivals this year as the sluggish recovery picks up pace, a leading global watchdog said yesterday. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast growth of 0.8 per cent in the UK in 2013 – slightly weaker than the 0.9 per cent previously expected. But it slashed its forecast for the eurozone from a decline of 0.1 per cent to a reverse of 0.6 per cent – with Britain doing better than Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Recovery: The UK economy will grow by just 0.8 per cent, the OECD predicts as it urged investment in infrastructure to secure growth. Pier Carlo Padoan, the group’s chief. economist, said: ‘The British economy is recovering slowly and that. reflects the fact that Europe is doing poorly. Growth is expected to. pick up gradually through 2013 and 2014.’ The Paris-based think tank said. Chancellor George Osborne’s austerity plans were ‘appropriate’ and. ‘necessary’ and added that the outlook in the UK was far brighter than. on the Continent, where the situation is ‘dire’. But, in its twice-yearly Economic. Outlook report, it said ‘much more needs to be done’ to repair Britain’s. battered finances and bolster growth. The OECD called for increased. spending on infrastructure projects such as housing and transport to. help the UK overcome the ‘strong headwinds’ buffeting the economy. ‘Continuing to shift the composition. of public expenditure in favour of infrastructure investment would. enhance growth prospects,’ said the organisation, which cast doubt over. the decision to protect large parts of public spending from cuts, such. as the NHS, education and overseas aid. Jorgen Elmeskov, its deputy chief. economist, said: ‘We are perhaps somewhat doubtful [as] to the idea of. ring-fencing certain spending areas. That tends to lead to deeper cuts. in other areas which may not be warranted. ‘You may or may not want to cut down. less on health than on other areas, but that should be a result of an. assessment of the costs and benefits of doing it, not because you carve. out health and thereby impose bigger adjustments on other expenditure. items.’ But the report from the OECD, which. represents around 30 of the world’s biggest economies, will come as a. relief to Mr Osborne as the austerity debate rages on. Construction: Chancellor George Osborne, pictured on a visit to the Port of Liverpool, is urged to invest in house building. The International Monetary Fund last week called on the Chancellor to loosen the purse strings this year to bolster growth. But the OECD said further cuts are. ‘necessary to store the sustainability of public finances’. It warned. that prolonged weakness in the eurozone ‘could evolve into stagnation. with negative implications for the global economy’. Growth forecasts in Germany were cut. from 0.6 per cent to 0.4 per cent while the OECD now expects the French. economy to shrink by 0.3 per cent instead of expand by 0.3 per cent. Spain and Italy are set to fare even worse. Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the. European Commission, admitted that governments need to ‘do more to help. themselves get back to growth and move Europe beyond the crisis’.

"(CNN) -- There was a time when Tel Aviv's beachfront was just another neighborhood sandwiched between the city's bustling Namal port district and historic old town. Not anymore. Today the area is home to some of Israel's most sought-after luxury real estate and has been dubbed the ""Golden Kilometer"" thanks to the rocketing cost of living space. A seventeenth floor apartment of 600 square meters (6,420 square feet) here sold for $23 million recently, a record for Tel Aviv. In the same area, a rented unit of 300 square meters (3,228 square feet) is on the market for $10 million. These premium prices represent a big change for a city that was brought to its knees due by large debts at the end of the 1990s. In the last four years alone, however, the waterfront property market has generated nearly half a billion dollars of investment. See also: Where are the world's most expensive luxury properties?

American plans for military strikes on Syria were in disarray last night after Russia seized on a blunder from US Secretary of State John Kerry. Mr Kerry suggested the Syrian tyrant could prevent international military action against his country by giving up his chemical weapons arsenal. He caused further confusion in Washington by promising any missile strikes that may take place would be ‘unbelievably small’. Scroll down for video. Pressure: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, left, called on Syria to comply with an American ultimatum to hand over its chemical weapons during a meeting with Syrian counterpart Walid al-Mouallem, right. Blunder: Secretary of State John Kerry, pictured, right, with William Hague, said Assad could prevent military action if he gives up his chemical weapons. Russia seized on the off-the-cuff. remarks, offering to start work ‘immediately’ to put Assad’s poison gas. stocks under ‘international control’. The plan was also welcomed by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon. Last. night the US government said it would take a ‘hard look’ at the Russian. proposal but had ‘serious scepticism’ about putting Syria’s chemical. weapons under international protection. But diplomatic sources said there had been no discussion at last week’s G20 summit of such a plan. One. said Mr Kerry’s intervention, made as he concluded a tour of Western. nations, risked complicating a crunch vote in the US Senate over whether. to back Barack Obama’s plans to use force against Syria. The Senate will vote tomorrow, the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on New York. However,. if President Obama fears losing the vote, some suspect he may yet use. Mr Kerry’s intervention as a device to delay. Talks: Russia offered to start work 'immediately' to put Assad's poison gas stocks under 'international control' after Kerry's comments. The idea President Assad. could hand over his weapons began as a flippant remark by Mr Kerry. yesterday morning in London after talks with Foreign Secretary William. Hague. The White House refused to say whether they agreed the line with. the secretary of state but one administration official told CNN it was. ‘a major goof’. Asked what. President Assad could do to avoid military action, Mr Kerry said: ‘He. can turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the. international community in the next week.’ He hastily added: ‘He isn’t about to do it and it can’t be done, obviously.’ Seeking. to assuage critics of military intervention, the US Secretary of State. insisted: ‘We are not talking about war. We are not going to war. 'We. will be able to hold Bashar Assad accountable without engaging in troops. on the ground or any prolonged kind of effort in a very limited, very. targeted, very short-term effort.’ Confusing: Kerry, right, also said any missile strike by the U.S. would be 'unbelievably small' Allies: Tyrant Bashar al-Assad, left, passed his. thanks on to Russian President Vladimir Putin for his ongoing support. in the G20 against a US led bid to launch military action against Syria.

"(CNN) -- Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico will not pardon legendary Wild West outlaw Billy the Kid in the death of a law enforcement officer more than a century ago, he said Friday. Richardson made the announcement on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" the same day he leaves office. The issue facing Richardson was whether one of his predecessors, Gov. Lew Wallace, promised about 130 years ago to pardon Billy the Kid -- known more formally as William H. Bonney -- for killing Sheriff William Brady of Lincoln County, New Mexico. Wallace has long been said to have promised a pardon if Bonney testified before a grand jury that was investigating another killing. Wallace did not follow through on that promise, many say, and the reasons are debated. Richardson said he believes that Wallace did promise to pardon Bonney. Yet there is ""historical ambiguity"" about why Wallace did not follow through, Richardson said, and he did not want to second-guess the former governor's decision. ""It was a very close call,"" Richardson said. ""The romanticism appealed to me to issue a pardon, but the facts and the evidence did not support it."" The governor acknowledged a positive side effect of his consideration of a pardon. ""It's good for tourism,"" he said. ""It's gotten great publicity for the state."" Billy the Kid was born Henry McCarty but was also known as Bonney and Henry Antrim. He died at the hands of Sheriff Pat Garrett 129 years ago. He was 21 at the time of his death. Wallace's great-grandson, William Wallace of Westport, Connecticut, has said there is no proof of an offered pardon. ""Where is the hard, concrete evidence?"" he asked CNN Friday, adding discussion of exactly what happened is full of ""gray areas."" While crediting Richardson for ""the correct rational track"" in his decision, Wallace said ""why the governor commenced this nonsense four months ago remains a mystery."" A pardon would have defamed his ancestor, Wallace said. ""(Lew Wallace) was a heroic figure in the history of the United States in the 19th century."" Some members of the Garrett family opposed a pardon. Besides arguing that Billy the Kid was an incorrigible killer, they wanted to make sure the sheriff was absolved of any wrongdoing related to the killing. Jarvis Patrick Garrett, the grandson of the sheriff, cheered the governor's decision Friday. ""Yay! No pardon! Looks like it will be a great New Year!"" he said. Richardson had said he would not do anything that cast a cloud on Garrett. Some residents, including Governor-elect Susana Martinez, said there are more pressing issues facing the state. Richardson, a Billy the Kid buff, examined a promise by Wallace, the territorial governor, about 130 years ago to issue the outlaw a pardon. ""A promise is a promise and should be enforced,"" said Albuquerque defense attorney Randi McGinn, who filed the petition for the pardon and volunteered to handle the case for free. Following Richardson's decision, McGinn said in an e-mail, ""We won the battle (acknowledgement of Lew Wallace's broken promise), but lost the war (the pardon). The historic debate will continue and perhaps a future New Mexico governor will grant justice for the Kid."" Garrett killed Billy the Kid on July 14, 1881, in Fort Sumner, weeks after the outlaw escaped from a jail. The sheriff, legend has it, was hiding in the dark and shot the Kid when he entered a room.

Feltz claims she only managed to stop Harris assaulting her by calling out for an advertisement break. Following her allegations, which date back to 1996, the presenter says that she's received an 'outpouring of misogyny and hatred' online. Speaking on the radio, she said: 'You think if people react like that, you can see why people don't come forward. 'I'm 52 and I can handle myself so imagine if I was a seven-year-old child, or 12 or 17. 'I'm not saying just if it's someone famous, but imagine if it was your dad, uncle or teacher. 'The kind of reaction I have had, I found so upsetting. 'I was upset by the outpouring of misogyny and hatred and you know ""Who would want to assault Vanessa Feltz?"".'

"United Nations (CNN) -- In a contentious closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting Tuesday, Russia criticized France's decision to airlift weapons to rebel forces in Libya, according to a Western diplomat present during the discussions. Earlier Tuesday, French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet told reporters that parachute drops of weapons into the North African nation were ""no longer necessary"" because opposition forces had become organized enough to procure their own arms. Rebels battling Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi are ""becoming more autonomous,"" Longuet said. ""This autonomy allows them to build relationships with external partners, including when it comes to equipping themselves in self-defense,"" he said. But even as Longuet said the weapons drops were no longer needed, debate over the approach continued. Russia brought up the issue at the U.N. Security Council session Tuesday, arguing that by sending weapons, France had violated the council's resolution that authorized NATO force in Libya, the Western diplomat said. France offered a detailed defense of the country's actions, arguing that supplying weapons was ""the only practical way of fulfilling"" the council's mandate authorizing force to take ""all necessary measures"" to protect civilians, the diplomat said. During Tuesday's meeting, ambassadors from the United Kingdom and United States defended France's actions, according to the Western diplomat. France acknowledged last Wednesday that it had supplied weapons to anti-Gadhafi forces, saying the weapons were provided for self-defense. ""It became clear that people there were defenseless and very much threatened by Gadhafi's forces,"" French Ministry of Defense spokesman Colonel Thierry Burkhard said last Wednesday. Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi told reporters last week that rebel forces were receiving arms from France but were not trained in their use. He said it was reckless of France to take such action, saying it went ""against all of the proclaimed aims of NATO's intervention in Libya.""

"By. Daily Mail Reporter. Google has bought a company that develops military-style drones in a controversial £36million deal. Titan Aerospace makes unmanned aircraft that run on solar power and can remain airborne for five years at a time. Google claims the technology will provide internet access to remote corners of the world. Scroll down for video. Google has bought a company that develops military-style drones in a £36million deal. But the move has provoked privacy concerns over the internet search giant’s ability to snoop on people from great heights. The drones fly at 65,000ft – almost twice as high as passenger planes. Because the machines are solar-powered and always above the clouds they do not need to land to refuel, so the drones are able to cover up to 3million miles before needing to land for maintenance. However, critics have raised fears over the company’s newly-acquired powers of mass global surveillance. The drones, pictured, are described as 'atmospheric satellites' that could be used for surveillance, to monitor weather and communication.

"(Travel + Leisure) -- When studying up for a trip to the Holy Land, you might come across this warning: Whatever you do, don't take a bear to the beach. Feeding pigeons is illegal in Venice, Italy, and could earn you a fine. Americans expect to experience some difference in laws when they travel the world, but some laws we found just sounded insane. In France, it's illegal to name a pig Napoleon. In Florida, single women can't parachute on Sundays. And in England, you may urinate anywhere in public, including inside a policeman's helmet, providing that you're also pregnant. Granted, most of us can rest easy on the plane ride to our destinations knowing that we won't run afoul of such rules. Plus, many reported laws are just urban legends, and in other cases, anomalies on the books that no one has the time or interest to enforce. (""People here don't keep bears!"" an exasperated Israeli spokeswoman told us. ""Why would they take one to the beach?"") But other laws -- such as keeping your headlights on at all times while driving in Denmark -- are in equal parts surprising and real. Get caught, and the resulting fine could run about $100 (and the entire EU may adopt the law). See a Travel + Leisure slideshow of the world's strangest laws. While some laws seem ridiculous at first blush, they often carry their own logic. Pigeon-feeding is not tolerated (and fine-worthy) in Venice, because the winged troublemakers -- and really, their droppings -- wreak havoc on the city's old, vulnerable buildings. Singapore is infamous for its tough laws against chewing gum and graffiti (remember the 18-year-old American who got caned in the 1990s?). In the Singaporeans' defense, the gum laws -- which have relaxed a bit -- were originally enacted to fight what authorities saw as rampant gum-wad littering. Even so, don't even think about leaving a public toilet un-flushed. It could cost you $100. What should you do if you do break a law, crazy or otherwise, while on vacation? Dick Atkins is a Philadelphia attorney who operates an international legal hotline, helping American travelers who have run afoul of the law in other countries. ""It's always best to try to get an attorney involved,"" he says. Ignoring the issue could result in problems if you make a return visit to that country. Atkins says he commonly deals with college kids who have taken too many liberties with other countries' lower drinking ages, or unsuspecting tourists who get arrested for trying to take home souvenirs (such as old rugs) that end up being antiquities. He says such problems raise the argument for buying travel insurance, or even buying travel assistance packages, which can offer legal help abroad. (To price varying packages, check out US Travel Insurance Association.) Of course, most Americans don't bother with travel insurance. In that case, you can contact the American embassy or consulate for a list of local attorneys. Or you can handle the problem on your own.

"Book claims knife used as murder weapon found in son's storage locker. Son Jason Simpson, a Miami chef, accused as 'the overlooked suspect' New claims: Private investigator William C Dear says he found the murder weapon in OJ Simpson's son's storage locker. A Texas private investigator claims he knows who really killed Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman in 1994. And it wasn't OJ Simpson. In a new book, 'OJ is Innocent and I Can Prove It,' William C. Dear alleges Simpson went on trial, and was acquitted of murder, in an. effort to deflect attention from the true killer: His son Jason. Dear says Simpson was at the crime scene -- but not until after his ex-wife and her friend had been stabbed to death. After a 17-year investigation, Dear says he has found circumstantial evidence that links Jason Simpson, 41, to the murders. The. private eye claims he dug through Jason Simpson's garbage and his. abandoned storage locker in search of new evidence, the New York Post. reported. In the search,. Dear says he found a hunting knife that forensic experts say is the. murder weapon that was never recovered during the police investigation. He. also found photographs of Jason Simpson wearing a knit cap, similar to. one that was discovered at the crime scene. Prosecutors were unable to. definitely link the hat to OJ Simpson, though hairs similar to his were found inside. Dear. calls Jason Simpson 'the overlooked suspect' and produced a documentary. film released in 2010 detailing the accusations that he is the. real culprit behind the murder. Stone-faced: At the moment his father was found not guilty, Jason Simpson, right, showed no emotion even as the people around his cried and celebrated. Open case: After 17 years, the brutal murders of Nicole Brown Simpson. (left) and her friend Ron Goldman (right) have not been officially. solved. GLOVES:. SOCKS:. FOOTPRINTS:. HAT :. *Defense argued framed by police. **DNA evidence found unreliable due to handling in lab. During the screening of his film in. 2011 he displayed a suspected murder weapon from the night of June 12,. 1994 at the DocMiami Film Festival. Dear. says two months before the murders, Jason Simpson assaulted his. girlfriend. The chef also deals with 'intermittent rage disorder,' according to the New York Post. 'That person who was wielding and welding that knife, had to know exactly what he was doing and he certainly had to be familiar with a knife. OJ wasn't,' Mr Dear said in his documentary. Despite these alleged findings, Jason Simpson's DNA and fingerprints were never compared to those found at the crime scene. He was never interviewed by police, either, the Post reports. No arrests other than Simpson's were made in the murders. OJ Simpson was the prime suspect for the murders because he helped to cover up his son's crimes and, in effect, allowed himself to take the fall, the book claims. 'The LA PD and the district attorney had made a rush to judgement,' Mr Dear said. At the time of the trial, Judge Lance Ito said from his bench: 'Those who say the criminal justice system itself is on trial may be right.'

In search of food, the peckish grizzly peered through the window and pawed at the doors while blonde-haired Lauren was inside. After a tense stand-off the bear used its claws to tear through a thinly screened window and climbed inside. Despite being just feet away from the bear Lauren, who works at the park as a boat captain, managed to hold her nerve and instead of fleeing the cabin, she stayed to capture the unbelievable moment on camera. She said: 'My suspicion is the bear had food on its mind. 'I was eating a sandwich at the time so I believe it approached the cabin in search of a free meal - maybe it could smell my sandwich and wanted a bite. 'I had no bear spray on me and guns are not allowed in a national park so I just had to stand my ground. The curious grizzly approaches the boating cabin in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in search of something to eat. Real-life Goldilocks Lauren Wilson was tucking into a sandwich in the cabin when she noticed the curious bear approach the front porch. In search of food, the peckish grizzly peered through the window and pawed at the doors while blonde-haired Lauren was inside. 'I yelled at it and banged pots and pans together to try scare it off, but that didn't work.' In search of a tasty snack, the inquisitive creature raided the cosy cabin, making itself at home as it sniffed around for grub while Laura was still inside. But it wasn't long before the park rangers arrived to scare the creature off, quickly ending its chances of a feast.

'I figured since I couldn't leave immediately and the bear seemed to want to stay put despite my efforts to scare it away, that I'd snap some pictures.

"(CNN) -- A few minutes of what was considered online fun, and one person is dead. Another is convicted of invasion of privacy and bias intimidation. When Rutgers student Dharun Ravi set up a spycam to catch roommate Tyler Clementi in a same-sex romantic moment, and when he tweeted about it and his plans to do it again, little did he think that Clementi would commit suicide or that he would face serious jail time and deportation. Ravi is learning his lesson the hard way. There are lessons for all of us:. What you do online can hurt people. Despite the adage about sticks and stones, words can and do hurt -- especially when anyone can publish information that reaches millions. The Internet is full of homophobic, racist, anti-Semitic and misogynistic content. At a minimum, hate speech is online pollution, but it can go much further. It reinforces stereotypes and strengthens the belief that singling out ""the other"" for abuse is acceptable. Hate speech can harden low self-esteem and intimidate its targets -- and even lead people to commit suicide. Online bystanders have a responsibility. Some students in the Rutgers dorm were amused by Ravi's spycam-Twitter scheme. Others ignored it. They should have been outraged, and they should have done something about it. ""If you see something, say something"" is not an admonition restricted to the security realm. Tools are online for each of us to flag and report content that is objectionable. Many online companies have staffs to review such reports and to take action, from removing the offensive content to ejecting the person who posted it. Each of us should take responsibility to combat hate-filled content. Speak up: Clicking to report hate speech to an online host is not all we can do. Justice Louis Brandeis, in a 1927 Supreme Court case, extolled the virtues of ""counter-speech"" to address objectionable speech. That pre-Internet admonition applies full force to online messages today. Hate speech legitimizes discrimination, and many of the people who post it believe no one objects. So object. Speak up to counter the lies of hate speech or the inappropriate online conduct directed at minorities. Just as the Internet provides thoughtless haters with broadcasting tools, each of us has those same tools at our disposal. A little counter-speech can go a long way. It's time to get serious about cyber-literacy and ethics. The lack of education in schools about the rules that apply to online posting is appalling. Kids are left to their own devices, literally, with little guidance. Given the power in everyone's hands to cause injury -- and to be injured -- schools should provide serious discussions of what is appropriate online behavior. We are well past the time when adults can think of themselves as the digital immigrants who don't fully understand new technologies, compared with their kids, the digital natives who better understand the online world. Privacy is a shared responsibility. Discussions about privacy usually revolve around consumer privacy and protection. But in this era of social media, when everyone can be a publisher and broadcaster, individual responsibility to respect privacy should be the focus. Most people would know that secretly setting up a webcam to spy on someone is wrong. But posting embarrassing photos and videos and making thoughtless comments can be a wrongful invasion of privacy as well. Each of us has a responsibility to consider the privacy implications of what we do online. Homophobia is not funny. Finally, while young straight people today are much more accepting of gay people, an undercurrent of homophobia remains.

David Mitchell, David Nicholls and past winner Howard Jacobson are all among the authors vying for the prestigious award, as its new global embrace gives fewer than half the places to British writers. A rule change has now opened the award to more international writers, enabling Americans to be included for the first time with four U.S. authors among the list of 13 announced. In the running: David Mitchell (left) and David Nicholls (right) are among the authors vying for the prestigious Man Booker Prize, as its new global embrace gives fewer than half the places to British writers. The remaining places go to Australian Richard Flanagan and two Irish writers Joseph O’Neill - who lives in New York - and Niall Williams. They would have been eligible under the previous rules which allowed authors from the Commonwealth and the Republic of Ireland. Organisers of the UK’s best-known fiction award - worth £50,000 to the winner - announced last year they were opening up the 46-year-old prize to writers of any nationality writing in English. Among the Brits in contention is Paul Kingsnorth whose debut novel The Wake, written in his own made-up language based on Old English - was published by independent publisher Unbound after being financed through online crowdfunding. Past winner: Howard Jacobson, who won the Man Booker in 2010 for his novel The Finkler Question, has made the longlist again with his new work J. The. list features celebrated writer David Nicholls, whose novels One Day. and Starter For 10 were adapted into movie hits, with his latest work Us. earning him a place. David Mitchell - in the running for his book The Bone Clocks - and Ali Smith - represented by her novel How To Be Both - have each made the shortlist on two previous occasions. Jacobson, who won the Booker in 2010 for The Finkler Question, has made the 2014 longlist for his book J. The other British writer to be included by the six-strong judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, is Calcutta-born Neel Mukherjee for The Lives Of Others.

"Kaufman County, Texas (CNN) -- It was, in the words of local newspaper reporter Denise Bell, a ""megatrial for a little community."" A justice of the peace, accused of ripping off taxpayers, labeled ""dishonorable"" by a top prosecutor after his conviction last year and stripped of his job and his law license. Now, amid an even larger investigation into the deaths of two Kaufman County prosecutors this year, that former official, Eric Williams, is jailed on $3 million bond -- charged with two counts of insufficient bond and one count of making a ""terroristic threat."" Authorities haven't explained the charges and they have not said if Williams' arrest over the weekend is related to the investigation into the deaths of District Attorney Mike McLelland, McLelland's wife, Cynthia, and Mark Hasse -- the prosecutor who last year accused Williams of ""using Kaufman County as his own piggy bank."" Hasse, Kaufman County's chief felony prosecutor, died in a brazen daytime shooting outside the courthouse January 31. Someone shot McLelland, the county's district attorney, and his wife, Cynthia, late last month at their Forney, Texas, home. Authorities have not named a suspect or a motive for the killings. Federal, state and local authorities looking into the killings searched Williams' home on Friday, according to an FBI spokeswoman. A day later, Texas Rangers and FBI agents combed through a storage facility in Seagoville, Texas, on a search warrant also tied to the prosecutors' deaths, the spokeswoman said. CNN affiliates KTVT and WFAA, citing anonymous sources, said authorities found 20 weapons and a white Ford Crown Victoria in the storage unit. The car, KTXA reported, matches the description of one seen near the McLellands' home around the time of their deaths. Authorities have not named Williams as a suspect in the deaths. Nor have they said the storage locker search had anything to do with the former justice of the peace, who has denied any involvement in the deaths through his attorneys and in interviews with local media. On Friday, Williams' attorney, David Sergi, released a statement saying his client ""has cooperated with law enforcement and vigorously denies any and all allegations. He wishes simply to get on with his life and hopes that the perpetrators are brought to justice."" Sergi did not respond to repeated e-mail and telephone messages over the weekend and Monday seeking comment on developments in the case. In March 2012 -- almost a year before McLelland's death -- Hasse and McLelland played prominent roles in prosecuting Williams on one count of burglary and one count of theft by a public official. Accused of stealing computer equipment from a county building, he was convicted and sentenced to two years of probation. After the trial, McLelland rejoiced that the conviction showed the county's ""good ol' boy network is gone,"" according to media reports. Hasse called Williams ""dishonorable"" and a liar, according to the reports. But in a statement filed with the court after his conviction, Williams denied the thefts and called the loss of his law license ""a life long sentence."" ""I will have to seek another career, with a felony I will not be able to earn what I am used to,"" he said, adding that it would be his wife, who he said was on disability, and his aging parents who would suffer the most. In a recent interview with North Texas TV station KXAS, Williams said he bore no ill will toward Hasse or McLelland, saying he felt the officials were just ""doing their jobs.""

Dethroning Britain's Lewis Hamilton in the latest episode of the show, host Jeremy Clarkson said Ricciardo made the best time he's ever seen. 'That’s the fastest anybody’s ever gone around our track,' Clarkson declared during the episode. Earlier in the week Daniel Ricciardo had already set his sights on toppling Hamilton this season - and his attempt at the famous Dunsfold Aerodrome site in Surrey was screened on February 8. Scroll down for video. Australian F1 driver Daniel Ricciardo has topped the leaderboard as the fastest driver in Top Gear's 'Star in a Reasonably Priced Car' challenge. Jeremy Clarkson (centre) said 'That’s the fastest anybody’s ever gone around our track' Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo (left) pose for a photograph at a 'Meet the Drivers' event at Milton Keynes' SnoZone on Tuesday. Hamilton, who clinched his second Formula One world title last year, took some beating as he is the fastest of all the F1 drivers to have taken to the makeshift circuit, ahead of the likes of Sebastian Vettel, Damon Hill, Nigel Mansell and Rubens Barrichello. The 30-year-old Mercedes driver set his time two years ago in the car reserved for the F1 stars, a Suzuki Liana. Ahead of his crack at Hamilton's time, 25-year-old Australian Ricciardo said: 'It's been a while since I heard people asking 'When are you going to go on Top Gear?', so the time has come.' Red Bull driver Ricciardo, who won three grands prix last season, added: 'I hope it's cold so the engine is crisp, but I also hope it's dry so I can actually have a good crack. Ricciardo tried his hand at sledging as the Formula One stars wrapped up in thermals to take to the slopes. Ricciardo addresses media after the event, where he spoke of his upcoming Top Gear appearance. Kvyat reaches the bottom of the slope as he enjoyed a day at Milton Keynes' Snozone. David Coulthard, a Formula One driver turned television pundit, took to the mic to ask some questions. 'We'll see how we go. I believe Lewis has the crown at the moment, so it would be nice to take at least one title off him.'

"While most people who enjoy flying might draw the line at a souvenir jet or mug, Anthony Toth's obsession has really taken off. The airline sales director has spent two decades amassing an unmatched collection of memorabilia from Pan Am, which he has converted into a replica cabin at his home in Redondo Beach, California. Mr Toth has spent $200,000 salvaging Pan Am airliner first class cabin parts for his airline tribute, including working seatbelt signs, oxygen masks and even 18 matching cabin seats. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Head in the clouds: Mr Toth, 44, has spent $200,000 over 20 years converting his garage into a replica Pan Am first class cabin. Cabin fever: Mr Toth says his favourite part of his replica Pan Am cabin is a staircase from an original airliner. Commitment: Mr Toth has traveled as far as Bangkok in search of the exact parts for his well-researched Pan Am cabin. He has now turned his 625 square-foot garage into a first class cabin from the airline, which was one of the biggest in the U.S. until its collapse in 1991. As well as seats and other accessories, Mr Toth has equipped the Pan Am cabin in his garage with all other in-flight accessories, including socks, eyeshades and extra headsets. He says his favourite part of his unique collection is a winding staircase which led to a first class cabin on a Pan Am 747 in the early 1970s. Lights out: Eye masks, blankets and towels are just some of the smaller additions Mr Toth has added to the replica in his garage. Mr Toth has scoured the globe in his quest to find 18 matching Pan Am first class cabin seats. Finer details: The airline sales director has even found oxygen masks and working seatbelt signs for extra authenticity. Authentic: Even the seatbelts in Mr Toth's converted cabin have the trademark Pan Am airliner logo. Mr Toth, Global Sales Director for United Airlines, said: 'To the people who live on the same street as me this is just the garage, but to me it's the Pan Am 747. 'What I really desire is, to be a part of what actually was the Pan Am cabin of the 1970’s and 80’s. ‘The great thing about Pan Am was that it was so identifiable – you could sit in that cabin and know exactly who you were flying with.' Safety conscious: Should there be an in-flight emergency, Mr Toth has gone to great lengths to make sure everyone in his garage is safe. Mr Toth's bizarre two-decade garage conversion has been featured on U.S. show My Crazy Obsession. In-flight comforts: Items of cutlery, paperwork and tray tables help are all part of the attention to detail from Mr Toth. Many of the pieces of regalia were collected from a salvage site for aircraft in the Mojave desert, California, where retired aircraft are stripped down for spare parts, but Mr Toth has also had to travel as far as Bangkok in Thailand to find the perfect additions to his creation. The collecter, who is now hoping that the cabin can be turned into a museum, isn’t as enamored by today’s first class service: ‘I didn't want to sleep when I flew,’ Mr Toth says. ‘I wanted to spend every minute enjoying everything that was happening.’ Mr Toth's bizarre collection has been featured along with other hoarders on U.S. programme My Crazy Obsession.

The Queen's London residence is exposed to the highest levels of air pollution in the country, figures reveal today. Traffic traveling along the A302 - known as Grosvenor Place - which runs adjacent to Buckingham Palace, produced the highest levels of toxic gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in 2012, data shows. Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs show the average level of the gas - produced mainly from diesel engine traffic fumes - was 152 micrograms per cubic metres of air. Buckingham Palace is exposed to the highest levels of air pollution in the country, data shows. Traffic along Grosvenor Place - which runs adjacent to the Palace - produced the highest levels of toxic gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in 2012 at 152 micrograms per cubic metres of air. The figure is almost four times the European legal limit of 40 micrograms per cubic metre. Lower Grosvenor Place, another road close to the Palace, registered as 109 micrograms per cubic metre. Other highly polluted areas include Oxford Street near Marble Arch, which registered at 150 micrograms and Cockspur Street near Trafalgar Square on 138 micrograms. The fourth and fifth locations were Park Lane and Knightsbridge - which measured 135 and 134 micrograms respectively. Roads near other top London tourist attractions such as Madam Tussauds, Hamleys Toy Shop and Covent Garden also featured on the list of 50 worst offenders - ALL of which were in London. The road running next to the Queen's London residence was the worst offender on a list of 50 locations provided by Defra. The European legal limit is 40 micrograms per cubic metre. A graphic showing the five locations with the highest levels of NO2 in the country, all in London - measured in micrograms per cubic metre of air. Outside London, Manchester Piccadilly scored 68, Belfast City Centre 63 and Nottingham City Centre 59 micrograms per cubic metre. Almost 30,000 people die every year due to respiratory problems caused by air pollution. Nitrogen dioxide in particular has been linked to breathing issues. Today environmental groups criticised the statistics. Simon Birkett, Founder and Director of Clean Air in London, said: 'These levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are nothing short of staggering. 'The World Health Organisation guideline is no human exposure in a single hour over 200 micrograms per cubic metre (with an annual average guideline of 40). Oxford Street near Trafalgar Square measured 150 micrograms per cubic metre. 'The thought that hundreds of thousands or millions of tourists and Londoners in a year may be exposed to air pollution this high is deeply troubling. 'In London, we need the Mayor to: ban the oldest cars emitting carcinogenic diesel exhaust as Berlin did more than four years ago, remove the turning circle requirement that still forces cabbies to choose between two large diesel taxis if they want a new vehicle and reinstate Phase 5 of the low emission zone that was a key commitment in the Mayor’s Air Quality Strategy until scrapped early last year. 'He also needs to ensure his ultra-low emission zone for 2020 includes the roads with the highest NO2 rather than excluding them which will force the most-polluting vehicles to join those avoiding the congestion charging zone and issue smog warnings to save lives, avoid hospitalisations and build public understanding of air pollution.

"(CNN) -- Renowned as much for her behavior out of the pool as her victories in it, Dawn Fraser is the greatest, and certainly most colorful female swimmer in Olympic history. Fraser was the first woman ever to successfully defend an Olympic title. The Australian won eight Olympic medals and was the first swimmer, either male or female, to win gold in the same event at three successive Olympiads. The youngest of eight children, she suffered from chronic childhood asthma and took up swimming to help improve her breathing. ""Mine was a complete love affair,"" she later recalled. ""It's a beautiful thing, diving into the cool crisp water and then just sort of being able to pull your body through the water and it opening up for you."" Her talent was spotted by coach Harry Gallagher, the latter agreeing to train her for free on account of her family's poverty. By the age of 16 she was already breaking national records, one of a group of outstanding young Australian female swimmers of that period known collectively as ""The Water Babes."" She came to world attention in February 1956 when she bettered Willy den Ouden's 20-year old world record for the 100-meters freestyle. At her first Olympics later that year, in Melbourne, she set another world record in the same event -- 62 seconds -- and took a second gold in the 4x100 meters freestyle relay, the latter also in a world record time (four minutes 17.1 seconds). Successful defense. She repeated her 100 meters freestyle victory in Rome four years later, the only Australian woman to win a gold medal at that particular Olympiad, and the first ever woman to successfully defend an Olympic swimming title. She also picked up two silver medals, in the 4x100 meters medley relay and 4x100 meters freestyle relay. For all her success, however, the 1960 Games were notable as much for her clashes with sponsors, teammates and Australian swimming officials as her triumphs in the pool. She was subsequently dropped from the Australian squad and, after further run-ins with officialdom, received a two-year ban from international competition. Despite this, and a horrific car crash in early 1964 in which her mother was killed and Fraser herself seriously injured, she again successfully defended her 100-meter freestyle title at the Tokyo Olympics, beating off a spirited challenge from Sharon Stouder of the United States to become the first swimmer ever to win the same event at three successive Games. The high-jinx and confrontations continued, however -- she was arrested for allegedly stealing a flag from the Japanese Imperial palace -- and shortly after the 1964 Olympics the Australian Swimming Union banned her for 10 years, bringing her competitive career to an end.

"Plus-size trendsetter Gabi Gregg has finally launched a second collection for Swimsuits For All today, filled with retro-style bikinis, tankinis, and maillot styles that come in brightly-colored prints. The designs follow the 26-year-old writer’s inaugural design outing for the online retailer, which left fans disappointed when the collection sold out in less than 48 hours last May. Much like her first swimsuit range, Miss Gregg’s new designs are offered in sizes 10 through 24 and hark back to the Fifties with high-waist ruched bottoms and full-coverage underwire tops. They are presently available for pre-sale and will ship after April 16. Styling: Following the success of Ms Gregg's blog, GabiFresh, she has designed a range of sellout swimwear for plus-size women (pictured in one of her designs) Miss Gregg’s second batch of designs for Swimsuits For All range in price from $43.50 for a bikini, to $58.50 for a ruffled tankini. These prices reflect the 25per cent promotional discount that Swimsuits For All is currently offering site-wide. Miss Gregg, a size 18 herself, has named the collection after her blogging alter-ego GabiFresh. She rose to acclaim last year after posting a call to action on her blog for plus-size readers to send photos of themselves wearing swimsuits. Thirty-one women responded to the call, and were featured on Miss Gregg’s site in a photo gallery which she titled ‘Fatkini’. Shortly after, Miss Gregg signed a deal with Swimsuits For All, telling fans of the collection on her site: ‘I'm super passionate about plus size women wearing great swimsuits unapologetically. Retro designs: Miss Gregg's designs accentuate a woman's curves with nostalgic, 1950s-inspired silhouettes. Many sized: Miss Gregg's collection comes in sizes 10 to 24. ‘After all of the excitement surrounding last year's Fatkini, I thought designing a few of my own would be a wonderful way to continue the movement.’ Upon the collection’s online release last May, she told Refinery 29 of the designs: ‘I think swimsuit shopping can be horrendous if you're going to stores that don't offer your size, but finding a stylish option that fits you well can actually make you feel great!’ Miss Gregg’s outlook on swimwear resonated so strongly with fans that the collection sold out in just hours. Bright patters: Each of the suits come in bright patterns, and are priced between $43 and $58.

"A new Tinder style app allows travellers to connect all over the globe, without having ever met in person. Tripr allows tourists and backpackers to maximise the social side of their trips, by introducing them to people who will be in the same place, at the same time - before they even get there. 'With Tripr, planning a trip becomes more about 'who' than it is about 'where' and 'when', CEO and Founder of Tripr, Nicolas Green, told MailOnline Travel. Scroll down for video. 'Planning a trip becomes more about 'who' than it is about 'where' and 'when', says Triper CEO, Nicolas Green. 'You can also see where your friends are going. No more fomo and much more social travelling. You'll never hear about a friend that was in the same city of you and you had no idea, ever again.' First, users create a profile, entering in information about their itinerary, the name of the city they'll be visiting or an attraction or event they're heading for. Then they enter their preferences about who they'd like to meet up with, and can start anonymously swiping through potential travel buddies. If two users 'like' each other - a connection is made, via Facebook. 'We chose to use Facebook for a few reasons,' Green said. 'First, it makes the initial sign-up significantly quicker; it also provides a degree of authentication that we would not be able to offer at this stage; and we are able to show how people are connected via different degrees of separation.' Users can anonymously swipe through potential travel buddies and make connection. 'We are aiming to fundamentally change the way that people travel,' says Green. 'At the moment, who a traveller can meet is limited to where they stay, what they do and chance. This drastically reduces the number of people that a traveller can meet.' The app has drawn comparisons to dating app Tinder, but Green says there's a lot more on offer with Tripr. 'We have seen a lot of people that are using Tinder to meet new people on their travels but have been put off by the more'sexual' nature of app. Travellers can match with locals, which is great for local advice like places to stay or things to do on your trip. 'The other problem that they experience is that they often get'matched' after they have already left. With Tripr you can connect well in advance. No more missed connections. 'The other bonus of Tripr is that you can match with locals, which is great for local advice like places to stay or things to do on your trip. People may well use Tripr for travel dating but we want it to be so much more. We want people to connect with like minded travellers regardless of sex.' And what of the potential dangers of meeting up with strangers? 'The advantage with Tripr is that for 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree connections, the user can see how they are connected,' says Green. 'This offers a degree of safety because the user can then ask the mutual friend for a reference on any new potential travel friend. The anonymous nature of the swiping also means that if you 'X' a user, they will not be able to contact you. You can only contact another tripr user if you both approve each other.' Users enter information such as they will be travelling and preferences about who they'd like to meet. 'The argument for its safety can be put like this; you could meet a stranger at a bar on your travels (degree of risk) or you could connect with them (potentially months in advance) on Tripr and get to know</s>",New travel app allows backpackers to arrange to meet up all over the globe.

Images from the archive of a tiny Cambridge computer lab show the incredible technological revolution that has taken place over a single generation. From the world's first programmable computer, created in 1949, to the chunky first calculator with huge buttons and a chip that led to the iPad - the Cambridge lab has pioneered it all. And as the lab this year celebrates its 75th anniversary, this collection shows the effect a two man team, set up in 1938 has had on millions worldwide. Even before it revolutionised the world with the first programmable computer, the lab was the first to use London firm Modivo's electric calculating machine, shown in a picture from the lab's archive below. Scroll down for video. The lab was initially home to some very basic machines such as this early electric calculating machine, which was built by London firm Moldivo, but used at the Lab. With over 100 buttons, it was capable of Multiplication, Automatic Division, Addition and Subtraction. At the time the lab was created, computing was done by people, often mathematically gifted young women who carried out tedious numerical calculations by hand. Founded in the 1938 as the University of Cambridge’s Mathematical Laboratory with just two men based in an old Anatomy School, the lab was today hailed by Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt of Google as instrumental in the technological revolution. It was one of the first customers of electric calculator, but staff soon invented EDSAC, the first programmable computer ever brought into general service. Users prepared programmes by punching them on to paper, and the room sized machine measured 5m by 2m - a far cry from today's handheld gadgets. EDSAC was the first of many technological breakthroughs at the lab, including the computer password, the webcam (developed so engineers could get fresh coffee), the BBC Micro and the ARM chip that powers dozens of smartphones and tablets, including Apple's iPad. Staff working on EDSAC, the first programmable computer for general use ever built. It became operational during 1949 after a three-year construction period at the computer lab at the University of Cambridge, which is celebrating its 75th birthday. The queue to use EDSAC II the first microprogrammable computer at the computer lab at the University of Cambridge. Users prepared programmes by punching them on to paper.

EDSAC was first introduced in 1949 when it completed its first programmed task by accurately calculating the squares of numbers from 0 to 99. The original Mathematical Laboratory, which opened in 1938 with just two men based in an old Anatomy School. Andy Hopper, professor of computer technology and current head of the lab, said: 'I believe that we are completely unique and that there is no other department in the world quite like us. 'Cambridge is the place where computers became a tool for general use, and the qualities that made that possible have never left us. 'They made us the biggest wealth conversion engine in the Cambridge cluster and therefore in Europe. 'And they have enabled us to achieve more than any other computer science department in the world.' In contrast with its humble beginnings, the centre is now home to dozens of staff and hundreds of students and is credited with giving rise to almost 200 technology firms. It was where EDSAC, the first programmable computer ever brought into general service, was built.

The ancient animal was discovered in July 2011 in a remote part of Russia, but scientists are now performing an autopsy in the hope that vital scientific information about the extinction of some bison species around 9,000 years ago will be revealed. The autopsy is thought to be the first in the world on such an old bison and scientists will now look for parasites that might have plagued the animals. The 9,000-year-old bison (pictured) was discovered in July 2011 in a remote part of Russia, but scientists are now performing an autopsy in the hope that vital scientific information about the dying out of the bison around 9,000 years ago will be revealed. The autopsy on the Yakutia specimen is the first in on the world on such an old bison. Scientists from a number of Russian and U.S. institutions are carrying out a full anatomic autopsy. This involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites. Histology samples – those showing the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of the animal - are thought to prove the most interesting, as scientists will be able to study parasites attached to ancient bison for the first time. Researchers hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison's digestive organs and to publish their research next year. The creature was found perfectly preserved in July 2011 in the Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia, on the shore of a lake in the north of Ust-Yana district, where woolly mammoth remains have previously been found. Its body became visible after part of the shore collapsed into the water. 'The discovery has an enormous value for scientists since it is the best preserved bison ever found,’ said Albert Protopopov, chief of the Mammoth Fauna Research Department of the Yakutian Academy of Sciences. He told The Siberian Times: ‘We have ascertained that the bison lived 9,000 years ago, at the very beginning of the Holocene epoch and died aged approximately four. 'By that time, many mammoths had died here, but the bison still lived.’ Scientists from a number of Russian and U.S. institutions are carrying out a full anatomic autopsy, which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites. The period began between 9,000 to 12,000 years ago at the close of the Ice Age. Earth began to warm and tundra became forest. Very large animals that had adapted to extreme cold like the woolly mammoth and woolly rhinoceros became extinct - although woolly mammoths may have lived side-by side bison in parts of Russia for a short time. Humans began to hunt smaller animals. One species, Bison priscus to which the bison undergoing autopsy might belong, lived in western Europe, central Asia and later in north America before dying out for an unknown reason. 'The careful and thorough examination we have begun will give us answers to many questions, first of all as to why did the bison die out'. Scientists from the Yakutian Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Geology of Diamond and Precious Metals, Yakutsk Agricultural Research Institute and the Agricultural Academy of Yakutsk are carrying out a full anatomic autopsy, which involves removing and describing</s>","Autopsy is thought to be the first in the world on such an old bison.

"Washington (CNN) -- Lawyers within the Obama administration disagreed with the president's decision that U.S. participation in the NATO-led Libyan military mission doesn't come under the War Powers Resolution, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday. President Barack Obama is in a stand-off with House Speaker John Boehner over the issue, and Congress might vote on measures to restrict funding for the mission this week to protest what Boehner says is Obama's violation of the war powers law. The president disagrees, based on a legal analysis of the situation backed by his general counsel, the State Department and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Carney said. ""This is not a unanimous legal decision within the administration, and it would be shocking if it were,"" Carney said in reference to what he called constant debate over the war powers measure since it was passed in 1973. ""... But the president makes the decision. Obviously, his White House (and) State Department lawyer also agree with his assessment, and we feel very confident that the legal reasoning is sound."" Carney also noted that Justice Department lawyers took part in the discussion, but he didn't include them among those he listed as supporting Obama. ""As the Justice Department has stated publicly, its views were heard,"" Carney told reporters. House Republican sources told CNN on Monday that several options are under consideration for votes this week -- probably Thursday -- to exert some congressional control over the Libya mission. No decision will be made on how to proceed until GOP legislators return Tuesday from a long weekend in their districts. Cafferty: Should Congress cut off funding? One idea is a vote to prohibit funding for any ground troops in Libya. Obama has pledged no ground forces will be sent to the mission, and the House Republican sources said the proposal would be intended to prevent any possible escalation in the mission and give legislators a chance to express their disapproval. ""Ultimately (the legislation) needs to have enough teeth for it to be to worth it,"" said one senior House GOP aide. The House already was planning to take up the 2012 defense spending bill this week, and legislators including liberal Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio intend to propose an amendment to cut off funding for the Libya mission. According to the House GOP sources, separate votes on the Libya mission are likely before the defense bill comes up in order to allow legislators to signal their displeasure through legislation that doesn't go as far as the proposal by Kucinich. In addition, House members were further angered by news of strong disagreement within the Obama administration over the president's analysis of whether the Libya mission came under the War Powers Resolution. GPS: Debate over War Powers Resolution. The New York Times reported Saturday that a lead attorney for the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel as well as counsel at the Pentagon argued internally that the president needs congressional authorization for the Libya mission, and the president overruled them. Carney's comments Monday acknowledged the disagreements, but portrayed them as part of the normal discourse on the war powers legislation. ""For me to get up and tell you that by some miracle, every lawyer in this administration was in agreement on that issue, you wouldn't believe me, because it's simply been too contentious for now 38 years,"" Carney said. Even if the House passes measures intended to limit funding for the Libya mission, it is unlikely the Senate would do the same. On Sunday, two influential Republican senators said Congress should support the military campaign to send the proper message to allies and foes. ""The president's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in Libya, but I will be no part of an effort to defund Libya or to try to cut off our efforts to bring (Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi down,"" conservative Sen.

"(CNN) -- Two pool employees and their supervisor were forced to resign on Wednesday after a woman's body went undetected in a public Massachusetts pool for four days in June until her body floated to the top. The Vietnam Veteran's Swimming Pool manager and assistant manager -- as well as the Southeast Regional Director of the state Department of Conservation and Recreation, have resigned -- according to a statement released by Edward Lambert, the agency's commissioner. Lambert requested they leave their posts because of ""poor decision making and failure to follow (department) pool protocols."" The resignations come in the wake of an investigation into the drowning of Marie Joseph, 36, on June 26. Joseph's body wasn't discovered until the evening of June 30 by teenagers at the pool in Fall River. ""This tragic event leaves heavy hearts in an agency that prides itself on its ability to provide high quality, safe, recreational opportunities for the residents of the Commonwealth,"" Lambert said in a statement. ""We hope that, as an agency, we will continue to work to restore and maintain the public's confidence in our ability to fulfill the mission expected of us by the Governor and residents who visit our facilities."" After Joseph's body was discovered, Lambert ordered the pool closed and appointed a team of officials to investigate her death. The pool's staff as well as the district manager who oversees the pool all were put on administrative leave. The investigation determined that poor water clarity was the primary factor that kept lifeguards from being aware of the drowning and finding Joseph after her death. In fact, the 12-foot-deep pool was so cloudy that it should not have opened the day she drowned, authorities said. Joseph had gone to the pool on Sunday with a 9-year-old neighbor and his family. She collided with the boy while the pair went down a pool slide, said Bristol County District Attorney's spokesman Gregg Miliote. After the collision, the boy surfaced but the woman did not, he said. It was not clear what happened after the collision or whether the boy and his family sought Joseph's whereabouts when they left the pool.

"Pope Francis washed the feet of a dozen prisoners, including young women, at a youth detention center in Rome as part of a Holy Thursday Mass ahead of Easter. The pontiff poured water over the young offenders' feet, wiped them with a white towel and kissed them. The act of foot-washing at the Mass of the Lord's Supper is part of the Christian tradition that mirrors Jesus' washing of his disciples' feet. Francis' decision to celebrate the Mass with young offenders at the Casal del Marmo center represents a break with tradition but is in step with his record in embracing simplicity and humility. The service has in past years been held at the grand Basilica of St. John Lateran, the official seat of the bishop of Rome. This time, the Mass ""will be, by his express desire, very simple,"" the Vatican said before the service. The young offenders were expected to give the pope a wooden crucifix and kneeler, which they made themselves in the detention center's workshop. In return, Francis was to bring Easter eggs and colomba, traditional Italian Easter cake in the shape of a dove, for all, the Vatican had said. The Casal del Marmo center houses close to 50 inmates, who range in age from 14 to 21. The young people who had their feet washed were chosen from different nationalities and diverse religious backgrounds. Two young women and two Muslims were included in the rite, according to the Vatican. Why is the pope washing prisoners' feet? More than 2,000 cardinals, archbishops, bishops and priests, as well as more than 10,000 of the Roman Catholic faithful, joined the pope in celebrating Mass in St. Peter's Basilica on Thursday morning. Francis urged the priests to be close to their congregations and listen to their everyday concerns, even if those concerns sometimes appear material or mundane. The priests should be ""shepherds who have the smell of their sheep,"" he said. Reaching out to the 'forgotten' Francis was installed as pope 10 days ago, having been elected to fill the shoes of Benedict XVI. Since taking on the role, he has focused on a message of helping the poor and needy. In his first general audience Wednesday, before crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square, he spoke of how following Christ ""means learning to come out of ourselves... in order to meet others, in order to go toward the edges of our existence, to take the first steps towards our brothers and sisters, especially those who are farthest from us, those who are forgotten, those who need understanding, consolation and assistance.""

"(CNN) -- Football club Barcelona paid 13.5 million euros ($18.5 million) in additional taxes on Monday, while denying any fiscal ""irregularities"" in its purchase of Brazilian superstar Neymar, which is now under investigation by a court. FC Barcelona announced the surprise payment on its website, which it called ""voluntary,"" just four days after a judge at Spain's National Court in Madrid filed preliminary charges against the fan-owned club for alleged tax fraud in the Neymar deal. ""The board (of Barcelona) denies the existence of any tax-related crime in relation to the fiscal obligations arising from the signing of the player (Neymar),"" the club's website said. ""Throughout the process, the club was receiving expert advice and at every moment the club's auditor was informed and had access to all the documentation concerning the negotiations."" Last Thursday, Judge Pablo Ruz expanded his investigation against the club, as requested a day earlier by a prosecutor, who alleged the club avoided paying 9 million euros (more than $12 million) in taxes on Neymar's signing and transfer, corresponding to contracts signed in 2011 and 2013. The judge is already investigating whether a former Barcelona president committed financial irregularities in the signing of Neymar. The club said on its website Monday: ""Given the existence of a possible divergent interpretation of the exact amount of tax responsibility arising from the signing, and to defend the club's reputation and good name, FC Barcelona has this morning made a complementary tax declaration of a total of 13,550,830.56 euros."" The reason, the club added, was ""to cover any potential interpretation made concerning the contracts signed in the transfer process for Neymar, although we remain convinced that the original tax payment was in line with our fiscal obligations."" Judge Ruz said in his writ last Thursday that the investigation would include a look at an alleged ""contract simulation presumably carried out by the parties which signed the contracts."" The expanded investigation would hold FC Barcelona responsible as an entity or business enterprise if found guilty of tax fraud, said a National Court spokesman, who by custom is not identified. The judge ordered Spain's tax collection agency to examine FC Barcelona's tax filings for 2011, 2012 and 2013, the writ said.

"By. James Chapman. PUBLISHED:. 19:07 EST, 24 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 07:45 EST, 25 January 2014. Spiralling: Director General Tony Hall will be told BBC must pick up cost of free TV licences for the elderly. The BBC will be told to pick up the spiralling cost to taxpayers of providing free TV licences to the elderly under plans being drawn up by the Conservatives. The bill for keeping licences free for the over-75s has risen to £600million, and an ageing population means that one in six households now gets the benefit regardless of income. There is growing controversy over the cost of pensioner benefits, which have been left untouched by the Government despite deep cuts to working-age welfare. The Daily Mail has learned that senior ministers are planning to tell the BBC it must absorb the annual cost of maintaining one of the main pensioner perks. Currently, the annual cost is met by the Department for Work and Pensions. It is thought that the plans will enrage the BBC, which has previously warned the Government that any attempts to cut its budget could result in the loss of channels such as BBC3 or BBC4. Free TV licences for the over-75s were introduced to win over the ‘grey vote’ by Gordon Brown in the 2001 election. David Cameron pledged to maintain universal pensioner benefits – including the TV licence, the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes – until 2015. But there are tensions in the Coalition over whether to maintain the commitment beyond the next election. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has been pushing for a review, and the Lib Dems have insisted they will not agree to further cuts to working-age welfare proposed by the Tories – such as limits on housing benefit for under-25s and an end to child benefits for jobless families with more than two children – unless the costs of universal pensioner benefits are also slashed. Three Tory ministers have privately told the Mail that forcing the BBC to pick up the cost for over-75 licences would allow the Government to say that while the benefit is to be maintained, taxpayers will save big sums. ‘The bill for this should be met by the BBC and it will be top of the list in the negotiations over charter renewal,’ said one. The number of homes claiming a free over-75 licence has soared by more than a million since 2001 to 4.25million, while the cost to the taxpayer has more than doubled from £308million to over £600million. Increases in longevity suggest that the cost will double again by 2030, when the average person is forecast to live long enough to be able to claim a free licence for more than a decade. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has pushed for a review universal pensioner benefits - including the TV licence, the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes. The move to land the BBC with the cost of maintaining free TV licences will pitch the Government into a row with the corporation, which will claim the cost could be absorbed only if it saves money by closing some services. The £600million-a-year cost roughly matches the entire £575million budget of BBC2. BBC insiders have already claimed that an extension of a six-year licence fee freeze imposed by the Government until 2016 would be impossible to manage. But ministers point to inflated salaries for executives and presenters, and vast pay-offs to departing staff, as evidence that the corporation can afford to make savings. Ministers are unlikely to agree to any significant increase in the licence fee, which raises £3.6billion a year to fund the BBC’s activities.

"By. George Rush. Determined: Just like his Breaking Bad character, R.J. Mitte has cerebral palsy - but that has not stopped him. The near-hysterical screams that met actor R.J. Mitte on the red carpet at the Golden Globes this year were befitting of a bona fide teenage heart-throb. The strikingly handsome 20-year-old now takes such adulation in his stride, having been a fixture for the past five years in the critically acclaimed US TV drama series Breaking Bad – the nail-biting conclusion of which will be screened next month. His nuanced and at times heartbreaking portrayal of a young disabled man, Walt Junior, struggling to cope with his father’s terminal cancer and his own physical problems, has won him unanimous praise. However, what marks out R.J. – real name, Roy Frank – is that he has the same disability as his character on screen: cerebral palsy (CP). The neurological condition normally occurs before or during birth for a number of reasons – usually lack of blood supply and therefore oxygen – meaning parts of the brain die or do not develop. The damage leads to, among other things, problems with muscle development, control and movement. In Breaking Bad, Walt Jnr relies on crutches. But, while R.J. spent his childhood in leg braces – CP causes involuntary muscle contractions that can lead to difficulty in straightening the limbs – his love of sport and exercise means that he now walks unaided. A third of those with CP have difficulty with speech, but in a similar way, Walt Jnr’s problems are slightly worse than R.J.’s. The show’s creator, Vince Gilligan, loosely based the character on a college friend who suffered a more severe form of CP, but had initially been auditioning able-bodied actors. After five auditions, R.J. landed the part. ‘It took a little bit of convincing, as at first Vince thought I was actually too able-bodied,’ R.J. says, explaining how he ‘regressed’ to his early days with CP by using crutches again and staying up late so grogginess would thicken his voice. ‘Playing Walt Jnr has been an eye-opener to what I’ve managed to become. Until I got the role, I never thought what I went through was something odd.’ Now he does ‘tons of yoga’ to fight leg stiffness and takes a prescription drug to relax his muscles. The approach is working. ‘If I stopped doing what I’m doing, it would get worse,’ says R.J. ‘I can’t tell you the last time I’ve gone to a doctor for my CP. I have it under control for the most part.’ At first there was nothing to suggest R.J., who was adopted a few weeks after his birth, had problems. But by the time he turned three, he had begun showing signs of impairment. ‘I had really bad elasticity in my legs,’ says R.J., who grew up in Louisiana. When he began to walk, he would tip-toe, something commonly seen in CP children due to tightness in the tendons. ‘He also had very rigid fingers,’ his mother Dyna remembers. ‘I had him tested [for brain impairment] but he scored really high on all of the tests. Most CP kids are very intelligent – it’s a misconception that they aren’t.’ When he took on the role as fellow cerebral palsy sufferer Walt Jr, son of the main character Walter White, R.J. had to learn how to walk on crutches</s>","Actor Roy Frank 'R.J.'

The dress was available to buy from the High Street chain's online store this morning, but within an hour of the Duchess of Cambridge stepping out in the polka dot garment it was out of stock. Bargain hunting fashionistas rushed to buy the £38 dress that fits Kate even though she's currently six months pregnant. Scroll down for video. Top choice: The Duchess wore this polka dot dress from the British brand to the Warner Bros film studios. Baby on board: At six months pregnant, Kate's baby bump is obvious but she doesn't have to wear maternity clothes yet. The Duchess teamed the black and white dress with a black Ralph Lauren jacket as she toured the Warner Bros film studios with Princes William and Harry. Kate, 31, has long been a fan of Topshop and has been seen in clothes from the British brand on numerous previous occasions. The Kate effect: The £38 dress sold out an hour after Kate was seen in it. Wizard day out: The Duchess visited the Harry Potter studios with husband William and Prince Harry. Just last month, Kate wore a £46 black shift dress from the store with a white Peter Pan collar as she attended the headquarters of Child Bereavement UK with her husband. The Duchess, who is due to give birth in July, was spotted browsing the rails of one of the store's London branches at the beginning of March. On that occasion, she was rumoured to. have bought a short floral print dress called 'Deirdre' that she has yet. to be seen wearing in public. Fan of the brand: Kate wore this black Topshop shift dress last month on an engagement with Prince William. Today isn't the first time Kate has caused a spike in sales at Topshop. Back in 2007, long before she was the Duchess, she was still making her mark as a style icon. When she was pictured out in a black and white patterned tunic from the store it flew off the shelves.

"Inspired: Jack Kerouac totally changed his style of writing after reading a 16,000-word, amphetamine-fuelled letter by his friend Neal Cassady. That letter is set to go up for auction in California next month. It has been called the letter that launched a literary genre. Neal Cassady wrote 16,000 amphetamine-fuelled, stream-of-consciousness words in a missive to Jack Kerouac in 1950. On reading them, Kerouac scrapped an early draft of his latest novel and, in a three-week writing binge, revised it into a style inspired by Cassady. That novel was On The Road, and its style became known as Beat literature. The letter, Kerouac said shortly before his death, would have transformed his counterculture muse Cassady into a towering literary figure, if only it hadn't been lost. Turns out it wasn't. It was just misplaced, for 60-some years. At least, so says Joe Maddalena, boss of Profiles in History, a southern California action house putting the letter up for sale next month. The letter is being offered as part of a collection including papers by E.E. Cummings, Kenneth Rexroth, Robert Penn Warren and other prominent literary figures. But Mr Maddalena believes the item bidders will want most is Cassady's 18-page, single-spaced screed describing a drunken, sexually charged, sometimes comical visit to his hometown of Denver. 'It's the seminal piece of literature of the Beat Generation, and there are so many rumours and speculation of what happened to it,' he told the Associated Press. Kerouac told The Paris Review in 1968 that poet Allen Ginsberg loaned the letter to a friend who lived on a houseboat in Northern California. Kerouac believed the friend then dropped it overboard. 'It was my property, a letter to me, so Allen shouldn't have been so careless with it, nor the guy on the houseboat,' he said. As for the quality of the letter, Kerouac described it this way: 'It was the greatest piece of writing I ever saw, better'n anybody in America, or at least enough to make Melville, Twain, Dreiser, Wolfe, I dunno who, spin in their graves.' It turns out Ginsberg apparently was trying to get it published when he mailed the letter to Golden Goose Press in San Francisco. There it remained, unopened, until the small publishing house folded. When it did, its owner planned to throw the letter in the trash, along with every other unopened submission he still had in his files. That was when the operator of a small, independent music label who shared an office with publisher Richard Emerson came to the rescue. He took every manuscript, letter and receipt in the Golden Goose Archives home with him.

A charity worker was found hanged after police took six hours to respond to a 999 call from her home where the line mysteriously cut out. The body of Susan James, 44, was found by a police officer sent to her home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, after she rang the emergency number but did not say anything. A post-mortem examination carried out on the businesswoman's body found that she died from hanging and police said they were not treating her death as suspicious. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating why it took so long for Thames Valley Police to send an officer following the mystery drop out call on September 13.

"By. Associated Press Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 14:24 EST, 17 March 2014. |. UPDATED:. 21:53 EST, 17 March 2014. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay has been arrested on suspicion of intoxicated driving, authorities said Monday. Irsay, 54, was arrested Sunday night in the northern Indianapolis suburb of Carmel on preliminary charges of driving while intoxicated and possession of a controlled substance, Hamilton County Sheriff's Department Deputy Bryant Orem said. The billionaire has been in and out of rehab over the years and has said he kicked his addiction to prescription painkillers - but sources close to the businessman say otherwise. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. James Irsay, owner of the NFL's Indianapolis Colts, was jailed early March 17. Friends say Irsay has been battling his drug problem for some time, and that his arrest could be a blessing in disguise. 'He's a sick, sick man,' one source told the Indy Star. 'He desperately needs help.' According to the Indy Star Irsay's recent dramatic weight loss - he went from 235lb to 165lb - has raised red flags among his friends and acquaintances. Irsay drove at a slow rate of speed, stopped in the roadway and failed to signal a turn before police stopped him, Lieutenant Joe Bickel of the Carmel Police Department said in a release. Teetotal: Irsay told Twitter followers that he hasn't had an alcoholic drink in 15 years last October. Jailed: Attorney James Voyles (left) and Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay leave the Hamilton County Jail in Indianapolis, Monday after Irsay was detained overnight. 'During the course of the investigation, Irsay subsequently failed several roadside field sobriety tests,' Bickel said. Myra Borshoff Cook, a spokeswoman for Irsay, declined to comment early Monday on his arrest. In an inventory of Irsay's vehicle,'multiple prescription drugs were discovered in pill bottles,' police said. 'These Schedule IV prescription drugs were not associated with any prescription bottles found in the vehicle.' Irsay, who frequently interacts with fans of the NFL team on Twitter, wrote an October 2013 tweet saying 'I don't drink...haven't in over 15 years.' Irsay acknowledged in 2002 that he had become dependent on painkillers after several years of orthopedic operations but said he had overcome the problem after undergoing treatment. Marion County prosecutors said the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigated how Irsay obtained the painkillers. Federal authorities wouldn't confirm any investigation was taking place. Prosecutors at the time said they saw no reason to charge Irsay. A plastic surgeon who wrote painkiller prescriptions for Irsay later surrendered his federal permit to prescribe narcotic drugs. League spokesman Greg Aiello said in an e-mail to USA Today Sports that Irsay, if found guilty, would be subject to league discipline, the same as a player would. Weight loss: A fuller-looking Jim Irsay addresses media about his team the Colts in 2012.

"Aurora, Colorado (CNN) -- A few reflections from survivors of the massacre at an Aurora, Colorado, theater from CNN interviews:. 'That's when I felt a big ole bang in my leg' Bonnie Kate Pourciau, 18, said she is ""not a huge Batman fan, really,"" but decided to go to the movie after she and her friend Elizabeth Sumrall stopped at a hotel in Aurora en route from Seattle to their homes in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. When the gunfire broke out, Pourciau told CNN affiliate KMGH from her bed in Aurora Medical Center, she thought it was special effects in the movie. But she soon realized what was going on. ""That's when I grabbed Elizabeth and we ducked under our seats."" Crouched behind her seat, she prayed. ""Lord, just protect us, keep us safe,"" she recalled thinking. ""That's when I felt a big ole bang in my leg."" Once the shooting stopped, Pourciau tried to run from the theater, but didn't get far. ""Of course, I fell because my knee is all gone,"" she said about the bullet wound that shattered her knee. ""I tried to run and just stumbled and fell."" By now, Pourciau and her friend had separated in the panic, and another movie patron risked his life by helping her scramble to the exit, where she and Sumrall reunited, she said. ""Elizabeth laid me on the concrete,"" and a police officer and a member of the National Guard soon approached. The officer carried her to a patrol car and the member of the National Guard wrapped her leg, which had been losing blood quickly. Despite the chaos, Pourciau said she felt calm. ""I was overwhelmed with the sense of security and peace -- that it was going to be OK,"" she said. Having already undergone three surgeries on her leg, Pourciau said she expected to be transferred Thursday to a hospital closer to her home. 'A silver lining to a very dark cloud' Baby Hugo was born Tuesday morning to Katie and Caleb Medley. They had gone to the movie as a treat before the expected delivery this week of their child. The gunfire did not strike Katie, but Caleb was shot in the face. He lost his right eye, suffered brain damage and is in critical condition. His brother said Caleb seems to understand what happened, but it was unclear whether he knew he has a baby boy. ""He's making small improvements, baby steps every day,"" said Seth Medley about his eldest brother. When the baby was taken into Caleb's hospital room, ""he moved his hand towards the baby, trying to feel his son, trying to touch him."" Caleb's heart rate and blood pressure rose, Seth said. Caleb had been doing standup comedy routines in Denver and was working full time at Target, but he had no health insurance, his brother said. Seth Medley said becoming an uncle was bittersweet for him. ""We were all looking forward to this,"" he said. ""It's a silver lining to a very dark cloud, but we all know Caleb, we know he's a fighter, we know he's not going to stay out of that child's life for any length of time if he can avoid it.""

'White widow' Islamist Samantha Lewthwaite was just an average British girl who was 'empty in confidence', a councillor who knew her as a youngster has said. But today suspicion is mounting that she was the ringleader behind a bloody massacre in a Kenyan shopping centre in which more than 60 unarmed victims have been slain. And it has emerged that her frail 85-year-old grandmother has been admitted to hospital because of the stress of her granddaughter's notoriety. Elizabeth Allen, from Banbridge, Co Down, was given a panic alarm to contact security services in case terror suspect Lewthwaite ever made contact. Family friends say the pressure of the situation and Lewthwaite's now-global notoriety have taken their toll on the frail pensioner's health and mental well-being. Joan Baird, a veteran Ulster Unionist councillor in Banbridge who knows the family, said: 'This is so distressing for everyone. Mrs Allen is 85 and she is in and out of hospital. It is just so distressing. 'Certainly, everybody in the town is shocked and distressed by the news.' Lewthwaite from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, who converted to Islam age 17, was married to Jermaine Lindsay before he blew himself up in the July 7 terror attacks in London in 2005, killing 26.

Early humans were able to hunt animals as large as a prehistoric elephant, according to fossils found at an ancient butchery site in Kent. Dr Francis Wenban-Smith discovered the remains of an extinct straight-tusked elephant along with a number of flint tools dating back 420,000 years ago in Ebbsfleet. It is thought the elephant, which was twice the size of today’s African variety, died after being hunted for its meat. Dr Francis Wenban-Smith discovered the remains of an extinct straight-tusked elephant along with a number of flint tools dating back 420,000 years ago in Ebbsfleet, Kent. The discovery was made during the construction of the High Speed 1 rail link from the Channel Tunnel to London in 2003. ‘My first thought was ""Oh no, how do we tell the High Speed 1 team that there is more archaeology to be dealt with?""’, Dr Wenban-Smith of Southampton University told MailOnline. ‘The Eureka moment for me was finding a flint core in amongst the elephant's rib cage - this confirmed the human association with the elephant. I was ecstatic.’ Researchers believe the deposits date to a warm period around 420,000 years ago, called Hoxnian interglacial. Since the excavation, Dr Wenban-Smith (pictured) has been carrying out a detailed analysis of evidence recovered from the site, including a number of flint tools found. It is thought the elephant, which was twice the size of today's African variety and up to four times the weight of family car, died after being hunted for its meat. How skilled early humans were in hunting is still a matter of hot debate, according to Southampton University’s Dr Francs Wenban-Smith. Prior to the discovery of these flint tools, evidence was largely based on clues about the age and sex of body parts of possible prey animals. ‘In this case, we infer the Ebbsfleet Elephant was hunted because the half-dozen Stone Age elephant butchery sites known from Europe are mostly prime adult males, and we do not think these would most often have died naturally,’ said Dr Francs Wenban-Smith. Since the excavation, Dr Wenban-Smith has been carrying out a detailed analysis of evidence recovered from the site. These include 80 undisturbed flint artefacts found scattered around the elephant carcass and used to butcher it. ‘Although there is no direct evidence of how this particular animal met its end, the discovery of flint tools close to the carcass confirm butchery for its meat, probably by a group of at least four individuals,’ said Dr Wenban-Smith. ‘The finding is massively important for our understanding of what early hominins were doing, and how they were able to colonise new terrain. ‘It's so rare to find undisturbed remains of any sort from this period. This new evidence confirms the importance of elephant in their diet.' Although it seems incredible that they could have killed such an animal, Dr Wenban Smith claims it must have been possible with wooden spears.

"By. Luke Garratt. PUBLISHED:. 09:32 EST, 13 March 2014. |. UPDATED:. 11:47 EST, 13 March 2014. Judge Judy, known for her high profile deliberations on televised drama-filled court cases, has filed a lawsuit of her own as she claims a lawyer used her image without her consent. The television judge, full name Judy Sheindlin, is filing a lawsuit against a Connecticut personal-injury lawyer, alleging that he had falsely produced advertisements saying she had endorsed his firm. She is seeking more than $75,000 in damages from Hartford attorney John Haymond and his firm, which mainly represents people seeking compensation for injuries. The lawsuit is the first that Judge Judy has ever filed, and she claims that it is because he is'shamelessly' using her image to promote himself without permission. Judith Sheindlin - otherwise known by her TV handle Judge Judy, has starred in her show of the same name for 18 years, and this lawsuit marks the first time she has filed anything of this kind against anyone. She said the unauthorised use of her name and image is 'outrageous' and requires action. She said: 'Mr Haymond is a lawyer and should know better. Judy Sheindlin says that if she wins, all of the proceeds will go to the 'Her Honor' scholarship scheme. The lawsuit says that without Sheindlin's permission, Haymond's firm aired television advertisements combining footage from 'Judge Judy' along with clips showing Haymond and his daughters, in an endorsement for the firm. It also says the advertisements aired in Connecticut and Massachusetts during broadcasts of her show, and continued even after Sheindlin's producer told the firm in March 2013 that use of her image was not permitted. The lawsuit says: 'By trading, without consent or authorization, on Sheindlin's well-known persona, the Haymond Defendants have irreparably harmed and damaged Sheindlin's hard-earned professional and artistic reputation, dignity, and prestige.'

"(CNN) -- A onetime medical student who was facing charges including first-degree murder in a killing tied to the Craigslist website died Sunday of an apparent suicide, police said. Philip Markoff was found unresponsive in his Boston, Massachusetts, jail cell at 10:17 a.m. Sunday and pronounced dead by medics, according to officials. The cause of death is under investigation, Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis and Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said in a statement. ""Markoff was alone in his cell and all evidence collected thus far indicates that he took his own life,"" the statement said. ""Nonetheless, as with all such cases, a comprehensive investigation will be conducted to determine the facts and circumstances surrounding his death."" An autopsy is scheduled to be conducted Monday, according to Jake Wark, a spokesman for Conley. Markoff, 24, was charged with the April 14, 2009, fatal shooting and attempted robbery of Julissa Brisman, 25, at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Police said that Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craiglist, a popular online classifieds service, and said Markoff may have met her through the site. In a statement Sunday, the family of Brisman said it was ""shocked and dismayed"" at the news of Markoff's apparent suicide. ""Their grief for Jullissa is as fresh today as the day over a year ago when Markoff took Julissa away from them,"" said the statement issued by a representative for the family. ""The long-awaited criminal prosecution was their only opportunity to confront him, and now he has taken that away as well."" The family promised to pursue ""other avenues to seek justice for Julissa and help ensure that others do not suffer from such devastating, unnecessary violence,"" according to the statement. Markoff was also charged with the April 10, 2009, robbery of Trisha Leffler at a Westin Hotel in Boston. Police reports said Leffler was robbed of $800 in cash and $250 in American Express gift cards and was held at gunpoint and bound. At his arraignment in June 2009, Markoff pleaded not guilty to the Massachusetts charges. He also was facing charges in an April 16, 2009, incident at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island. In that incident, police said Markoff tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room, and the suspect fled after pointing his gun at the husband, according to Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney. At the time of his April 2009 arrest, Markoff was a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine and was engaged to be married. His friends and acquaintances expressed shock, describing him as a model student and the ""all-American"" guy. A woman identifying herself as Megan McAllister, his fiancee, maintained his innocence in an April 2009 e-mail sent to ABC News, saying Markoff ""is the wrong man"" and ""was set up."" ""Unfortunately, you were given the wrong information as was the public,"" she said. ""All I have to say to you is Philip is a beautiful person inside and out and could not hurt a fly!"" Markoff's attorney had also proclaimed his innocence. Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley told reporters last year that Brisman's death was ""a brutal, vicious crime -- savage. And it shows that Philip Markoff is a man who's willing to take advantage of women -- to hurt them, to beat them, to rob them.""

"(CNN) -- As Tax Day approaches, Tea Party activists are uniting to voice the message they've been honing for more than a year: It's time to reduce the size of government, honor the Constitution and return to fiscal responsibility in Washington. The Tea Party Express' third cross-country tour brings activists to Boston, Massachusetts, on Wednesday, before culminating with an anti-tax rally at the nation's capital on Thursday. The ""Just Vote Them Out!"" tour has weaved through areas represented by vulnerable Democrats, bringing thousands to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's hometown in Nevada on its opening day. The tour's other top target -- Democratic Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan -- announced his retirement the same day the tour was in his turf. Tea Party favorite Sarah Palin was the top draw at the Boston event. Republican Sen. Scott Brown, whose winning Massachusetts campaign was infused by the Tea Party, turned down his invitation to the event, although his office said he wished the rally success. Are you at a Tea Party rally? Share your images. So far, the movement's success is in the eye of the beholder. Tea Party activists running for office have yet to make much impact in the Republican primaries, and Stupak rejected the notion that the Tea Party played a role in his decision to step down. Tea Party changes tone, not outcome of Texas primary. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer admitted Tuesday that the protests and rallies by the Tea Party across the country are having an impact on lawmakers' decisions about running for another term. ""Do I think that negative atmosphere that's been created by the Tea Party and by others certainly goes into the thinking of members? I think it does. I think you honestly have to point out that it does,"" Hoyer said. Hoyer: Tea Party having an impact. The Tea Party developed last year in protest to what its supporters saw as overspending in Washington -- by Republicans and Democrats -- following the stimulus bill, the bank bailouts and President Obama's budget. Fueled by anger at the government and fear of where the country was headed, it grew from dozens to hundreds of loosely linked groups. Until recently, there had been little movement toward coalescing as a formal party. Last week, a broad coalition of national and regional Tea Party groups announced the formation of the National Tea Party Federation. Tea Party movement attempts to unite? Tom De Luca, a professor of political science at Fordham University, said while Tea Party activists have affected the national agenda, the larger impact has been on the Republican Party. ""It's energized the hardcore base of Republicans who tend to share a lot of Tea Party ideas, but on the other hand, it's going to bring to the floor a split that has been in the Republican Party for quite a long time,"" De Luca said. That split pits the more conservative elements of the party against moderate Republicans. At the Southern Republican Leadership Conference last weekend, a Tea Party member voiced a concern to former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum that the moderate Republicans -- and not conservatives -- would end up on the ballot in November. ""Go beat them,"" he told the attendee. ""That's what elections are all about. I encourage candidates to run,"" Santorum said, adding the GOP must focus its energy on electing conservative candidates in the Republican primaries. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, said last week that the Republican Party and the Tea Party are in the process of merging. Bachmann: GOP and Tea Party movement are'merging' If the Tea Party pushes Republicans further to the right, however, it could hurt them in November, De Luca noted. Centrist voters would likely favor a Democrat over a far-right Republican, he said. Republican Mississippi Gov.

"At Selhurst Park last Saturday, when Chelsea were playing Crystal Palace, an act of supreme sportsmanship passed almost unnoticed. Not quite in the same league as Paolo Di Canio when he caught the ball inside the Everton penalty area at Goodison Park after Paul Gerrard dislocated his knee in December 2000. Or UEFA giving Robbie Fowler a fair play award after he pleaded with referee Gerald Ashby not to award a penalty to Liverpool when he went down under a challenge from Arsenal keeper David Seaman in 1997. Jose Mourinho (right) shaking hands with Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock on Saturday. Mourinho celebrates Chelsea's victory after a match during which he showed his more generous side. A smiling Mourinho speaks during the pre-match press conference before Chelsea faced Maribor. Still, Jose Mourinho’s generosity should be highlighted, particularly after a weekend of football that finished with Swansea manager Garry Monk accusing Stoke winger Victor Moses of cheating. Mourinho’s rampant Chelsea team were 2-0 up passing the ball for fun as Palace willed it to go out of play for them to make a substitution. At the time, with Chelsea in complete control after goals from Oscar and Cesc Fabregas, it felt like Palace manager Neil Warnock would be made to wait for ever. Both teams were already down to 10. Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta was sent off for a studs-up challenge on Mile Jedinak and Palace defender Damien Delaney was sent off for a second booking before half-time. With 21 minutes left, Warnock’s team were temporarily reduced to nine when James McArthur was forced off the field with an ankle injury. It was then that Mourinho approached Warnock in the technical area. Mourinho passed a message to Fabregas, the closest Chelsea player to the technical area and his team suddenly eased off. Palace were finally able to get the ball out of play. Warnock made the substitution, bringing on Adlene Guedioura to replace McArthur to even the teams up, numerically at least. To Mourinho’s credit he then instructed Oscar, who received the ball from Chelsea’s throw-in, to kick the ball back to Palace keeper Julian Speroni. The Brazilian obliged. It was a magnificent sporting gesture. There are times when it is easy to bury Mourinho for his touchline posturing, but he has been on his best behaviour of late. Against Arsenal on October 5, he had very little involvement in the incident which led to Arsene Wenger shoving him in the chest during their 2-0 defeat. There was the usual mischief in the air last Friday when he reacted to news that Wenger had got off scott-free after the incident at Stamford Bridge. ‘Me? Me? Me?’ he joked. ‘Stadium ban’. He has taken to answering tricky situations by lacing them with sarcasm to avoid appearances on the back pages for all the wrong reasons. Mourinho is usually far more gracious when his team are winning and he is has certainly been in a better mood of late. Arsene Wenger and Mourinho during their infamous touchline spat in Chelsea's win over Arsenal. Ahead of the game at Palace, which they eventually won 2-1, Chelsea’s manager claimed he is ‘a humble guy who tries to learn every day’. He was referring to Roy Keane’s criticism of Mourinho after he attempted to shake hands with Paul Lambert when his team were beating Aston Villa 3-0 on September 27. He is no angel on the touchline, we know that</s>",Jose Mourinho made Chelsea put ball out when Crystal Palace were a man down at Selhurst Park on Saturday. It was a magnificent sporting gesture from the Chelsea manager. Mourinho has been on his best behaviour on the touchline of late.

"By. James Nye. Carol the elephant has been welcomed back to Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Mississippi after her mysterious drive-by shooting this time last year. The 40-year-old circus favorite will take to the stage in Tupelo on Thursday night after rehabilitation from being shot in the shoulder in the early hours of April 9 while in her enclosure. No one has ever been arrested for the attack despite a $34,000 reward - the only lead being grainy surveillance footage showing a white SUV speeding away from the scene at 2am. Scroll Down for Video. Return: Carol the elephant was shot last year in April while in Tupelo, Mississippi in a shocking crime that has never been solved. 'She's back with a vengeance,' trainer Kathy Carden said. 'She's awesome.' Tupelo Police Lt. Jerry Davis said he’s frustrated, but will not give up hope of making an arrest. 'The case is still being investigated,' he told NBC News. 'Detectives are still working on it; we just do not have any new information to follow up on at this time.' The Mayor of Tupelo, Jason Shelton, said the attack was cruel and he is annoyed they have not caught the culprits. 'It was quite frankly an embarrassing moment for the city, but hopefully those days are behind us,' said Shelton. The shooting led to improved security for the animals of the circus in their fenced-in parking lot home. Elephant and trainer: Kathy Carden said that Carol is ready for her return and has not been affected by the shooting. Wound: This is where Carol was shot - just behind the neck in the shoulder. All healed: There are still bullet fragments in Carol's wound which means that police have not been able to do a full ballistics analysis of the shooting. And for the past year, trucks have been parked in a ring around the animals to add to their protection. And for this week, Tupelo Police said that they will increase their patrols around the animals while the Barnum & Bailey's show is in town. Kathy Carden said that Carol is not nervous about returning to action. 'I’m excited to get there and see everybody and show everybody in Tupelo that Carol is great,' she said. Headlights: The only evidence that police have to go on is this surveillance footage which shows two faint car lights of a white SUV. Friends: Cathy and Carol stare into each others eyes - happy to be reunited on the stage for Thursdays circus. Head over heels happy: Carol happily performs - ready for her return to Tupelo tonight in Mississippi. Cathy said that despite their reputation, she believes that Carol doesn't fully comprehend what happened to her.

"By. Corey Charlton. A passenger ferry carrying hundreds of people has capsized in central Bangladesh, killing at least two people and probably many more as horrified villagers watched from the shore. It is unclear exactly how many people were on board the M.V. Pinak because ferry operators in Bangladesh rarely maintain passenger lists. Local media said there were about 250 passengers, but the figure could not be immediately confirmed. Scroll down for video. Bangladeshis mourn for missing relatives who were on board the ferry which capsized on the Padma river. The ferry, which could have been carrying up to 250 people, capsized 30km south of the capital Dhaka. Hundreds of onlookers gather on the shores of the Bangladesh river near where the accident occurred. Azizul Haque, 30, was among at least 44 people who survived by swimming to shore, said he jumped overboard when it became clear the ferry was going down. He said: 'The ferry went out of control due to wind and current, tilting from one side to the other. 'Then the captain jumped out because he probably understood it was sinking. The river was rough, and there were many passengers on board.' The ferry capsized in the Padma River in Munshiganj district, about 44 kilometers (28 miles) south of the capital, Dhaka. More than four hours after the ferry capsized, authorities said they were still waiting for a larger vessel needed to launch a proper rescue operation. Local police officer Khalid Hossain said two bodies had been recovered so far. 'We are waiting for a big rescue vessel which is on its way,' said Nurul Alam Dulal, a local fire official. 'It's very difficult to go there at the scene and stay afloat.' Jasim Uddin, 35, was among a crowd of people who watched the vessel go down from the shore, recording it on his cellphone as it disappeared. Rescuers searching the river where the passenger ferry capsized. The death toll is expected to rise sharply. Many people die on Bangladeshi rivers every year, where ferry travel is common and safety standards poor. Witnesses described seeing survivors swimming to shore and praying after they were picked up rescue boats. When the survivors began to come to shore, he said they were exhausted and panicked. 'One woman swam nearly to shore and was picked up by a speedboat,' he said. 'She was crying, saying she has two daughters. It was panic. Everyone was praying to God.'

"(CNN) -- When Darla Arni's mother began showing the first signs of dementia 16 years ago, Arni worried she was doomed to the same fate. So Arni began reading up on what she could do to stay mentally sharp. Turns out, plenty. Arni, now 55, grew up on a farm where her mother fried just about everything in lard. Today, she skips the fried foods and eats plenty of fruits and vegetables, takes fish oil pills, goes for regular walks and meditates during a weekly yoga class. ""I'm doing everything I can,"" says Arni, a public speaker and author who lives in Slater, Missouri. And what's the point? Doctors who specialize in the aging brain say that dementia is not inevitable, even in very old age. Making positive lifestyle changes earlier in life, they say, can lessen the chances of the faulty thinking and flagging memory that often come with advancing years. Dr. Gary Small, director of UCLA's Longevity Center, says lifestyle may play a bigger role than genetics when it comes to who will fall into what he calls the ""mental fog"" of dementia. Alzheimer's is perhaps the best known and most feared form of dementia. Early onset Alzheimer's disease, which often has a strong genetic component, may not be delayed with any lifestyle changes. But late-life Alzheimer's, affecting people in their 80s and 90s, has only a minor genetic component and can be delayed or prevented with lifestyle changes -- especially if the changes begin in midlife, says Dr. Majid Fotuhi, chairman of the Neurology Institute for Brain Health and Fitness and a neurology professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I say, 'Dance' Fotuhi began ballroom dancing when he was a student at Harvard Medical School. It was a break from all the studying. More than that, it was fun. Now a neurologist, Fotuhi still dances. He and his wife, Bita, have mastered the tango. As an expert on how the brain ages, Fotuhi sees another benefit: Dancing is the perfect activity to keep the brain young. ""When people say, 'What's the one thing I can do?' I say, 'Dance.' "" Fotuhi says. The answer to keeping the brain sharp, neurologists agree, is not sudoku or crossword puzzles -- despite the conventional wisdom. Staying physically fit is the most important element to keeping the brain young later in life, they say. Remaining socially engaged and mentally active in new and challenging ways are the two other components to long-term brain health. Fotuhi says ballroom dancing is perfect because it combines physical activity, social interaction and the mental challenge of remembering the steps. Growing the brain. Using new, more powerful MRI scanners, researchers have shown how even moderate exercise can actually increase the size of the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for forming memories, essentially turning back the clock and making the brain younger. ""We have found this treasure, this amazing phenomenon that the brain can grow,"" Fotuhi says. After 50, the brain -- and the hippocampus -- typically begins losing volume. The hippocampus loses 1% of its volume every two years and accelerates up to 2% per year later in life. But this loss is not set in stone. Dr. Arthur Kramer at the University of Illinois and his colleagues took 120 older adults and put half of them into an exercise group, which walked three days a week, and the other half on a stretching regimen. After a year, the group that walked had better memory than at the start of the study. More than that</s>","Doctors who specialize in the aging brain say that dementia is not inevitable.

"Angelo Henriquez is hoping that a successful loan spell away from Manchester United will catch the eye of manager Louis van Gaal. The 20-year-old Chile international will face Glasgow giants Celtic in the Europa League on Thursday evening, as he turns out for loan employers Dinamo Zagreb - where he will spend the season on loan from the Red Devils. Henriquez is all to aware that he needs to make this loan spell in Croatia count after previous spells at both Wigan Athletic and Real Zaragoza, but insists the temporary move to Zagreb is not a step down. Angelo Henriquez in action for Dinamo Zagreb during the Europa League earlier this month. Henriquez celebrates scoring for Manchester United against AIK during a friendly last summer. He said: 'I don't think it was a backwards step in my career (joining Dinamo) but a good chance to play and get experience of European football.

"Esteemed author Harper Lee has denied giving permission to a journalist to document her life in a highly-anticipated new memoir. The reclusive writer of To Kill A Mockingbird has shunned the spotlight following the success of her Pulitzer prize-winning first and only novel in 1960, refusing to do interviews or make public appearances. However Marja Mills, a former Chicago Tribune reporter, claims to have become friends with Lee after moving into the house next door to her in Monroeville, Alabama, for 18 months in 2004. Mills has now written a book about the experience, The Mockingbird Next Door: Life With Harper Lee, which was released by The Penguin Press on Tuesday and is being pushed as the first official account of Lee's life. Hitting back: Extremely private author Harper Lee, 88, has released a statement saying she did not cooperate with a new book about her life and that she was'saddened' and 'hurt' by the writer. Under fire: Journalist Marja Mills (left) maintains she was always honest with Harper Lee during their 18-month friendship that she was writing a book. As Mills writes: 'I wasn't an unknown quantity but someone she (Harper Lee) knew and trusted.' 'I could not have done (the book) without the trust, support, and encouragement of Nelle (as Harper Lee is known) and (her sister) Alice Lee and their closest friends.' But Lee, 88, has now released a letter to Entertainment Weekly to deny having anything to do with the project. 'Miss Mills befriended my elderly sister, Alice. It did not take long to discover Marja's true mission: another book about Harper Lee,' the statement said. 'I was hurt, angry, saddened, but not surprised. 'I immediately cut off all contact with Miss Mills, leaving town whenever she headed this way. 'Rest assured, as long as I am alive, any book purporting to be with my cooperation is a falsehood.' It is the second statement Lee has released on the book. The first was dated April 27, 2011. At the time Lee wrote: 'Contrary to recent news reports, I have not willingly participated in any book written or to be written by Marja Mills. Neither have I authorized such a book.' A big part of the dispute is a letter Mills has written by Lee's sister Alice. 'Delicious mystery': Harper Lee, 88, has lived an extremely private life since the release of her first and only book, To Kill A Mockingbird, in 1960. Responding to the claims on Tuesday, Mills refers to the letter, while maintaining her book is not a Harper Lee biography but a collection of stories that Lee chose to share with her. The written letter I have from Alice Lee, which she sent May 2011 in response to the original letter issued in Nelle's name, makes clear that Nelle Harper Lee and Alice gave me their blessing,' Mills said. 'In regard to the writing and release of Nelle Harper Lee's April 2011 statement about my book, Alice Lee (Alice Lee practiced law until she was 100 years old) wrote: 'Poor Nelle Harper can't see and can't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence. Now she has no memory of the incident.' "" Penguin also released a statement on Tuesday, saying: 'Penguin Press is proud to publish The Mockingbird Next Door: Life with Harper Lee by Marja Mills today.

"By. Ian Drury. Britain's Prince Harry attends a mission briefing in the British controlled flight-line in Camp Bastion. Blunders by British commanders were ‘devastatingly exploited’ by the Taliban to carry out an attack on Camp Bastion while Prince Harry was deployed in Afghanistan, a damning report says today. Complacency by senior officers meant security was inadequate, allowing heavily-armed insurgents to storm the supposedly impregnable UK base in 2012. The defence select committee was also scathing about the Ministry of Defence, accusing officials of being ‘obstructive and unhelpful’ in the face of the committee’s inquiries to establish what had happened. Two US Marines were killed and 16 troops – eight US and eight British – injured when gunmen swarmed through the perimeter fence to assault the airfield, setting off explosions which destroyed six Harrier jump jets and three vehicles. Prince Harry was stationed at Bastion to fly Apache attack helicopters. The committee found more than half of the guard towers were regularly unmanned despite at least 20 breaches of the perimeter fence in two years. Troops were exposed to ‘unnecessary risk’ because UK commanders, who were responsible for security, had not put in place sufficient safeguards to ensure a Taliban attack was foiled. Following a US investigation into the incident, two generals were ordered to quit. Incredibly, no-one from Britain has paid the price for the fiasco. The Mail understands at least four officers involved have been promoted. In a highly critical conclusion, the cross-party committee said: ‘We are concerned that the perimeter security and force protection measures in place at the time of the attack were inadequate. ‘Insufficient attention was given to the fundamental requirement of defending Camp Bastion from external assault. Two US Marines were killed and 16 troops injured when gunmen swarmed through the perimeter fence to assault the airfield. 'We believe this was complacent. Given that the attack took place in the British sector of the camp, British commanders must bear a degree of responsibility for these systemic failures.’ The attack on Camp Bastion, which sprawls over 20 sq miles of Helmand, southern Afghanistan, took place on September 14, 2012.

"Washington (CNN) -- About 250 veterans gathered today at the World War II Memorial in Washington. They were joined by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg to mark the premiere of their 10-part HBO series, ""The Pacific."" It was a high-profile public media event, but for me it was personal. For me, it brought back memories of my dad, who fought the Nazis in Europe. When I was 9 or 10 years old, my father took me to a college basketball game. As the clock ran out, a trumpeter in the pep band thought it would be cute to mark the demise of the rival team by playing Taps. Dad was not amused. ""Shut up!"" he roared. The trumpeter played on, oblivious. Dad got to his feet, fists clenched. ""I said, 'Shut up!'"" Embarrassed, I cringed in my seat. I'd never seen Dad this upset. But most people in the noisy auditorium were unaware of his wrath. He was drowned out by cheers, and by amused laughter at the cleverness of the trumpeter. Later, Dad explained to me that his strong emotions went back nearly 15 years when he was an officer on Gen. William Woodward's staff during the 104th Infantry Division's assault on Nazi Germany. Under the leadership of Maj. Gen. Terry Allen, the ""Timberwolves"" fought through Holland, Belgium, and into Germany, seeing unbelievable carnage. Some men became numb to it. Dad told me about seeing a couple of soldiers carelessly tossing bodies into the back of a truck to be hauled away from the battlefield. As Dad watched, a passing officer angrily chewed out the men:. ""These are soldiers of the United States Army,"" the officer yelled, ""and they will be treated with respect!"" Whenever Dad told that story, his voice would catch. Fast forward. Spring 1995 -- 50 years after the Nazis surrendered and some 35 years after that basketball game. His emotions were still raw as we sat together on the back porch of my home in suburban Atlanta. Over the course of three days, I held a small tape recorder between us as he talked about his life. Not surprisingly, his days in combat with the 104th took up most of the eight hours I captured on tape. Dad was a shy man, placid, slow to anger. Rarely did he show much emotion of any kind, except laughter -- he loved to laugh. So, it was unexpected when, during a taping session, he suddenly broke down and wept. He'd been describing the day he came across a group of Timberwolf infantrymen who'd been caught in a crossfire and slaughtered. ""If it hadn't been for those guys in the infantry,"" he said, swiping at his tears, ""I never would have survived the war."" My dad, N. George DeDakis, remained in the Army Reserves after WWII, retiring as a colonel in 1960. He practiced law in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and died May 29, 1996, at the age of 88. I went in his place to the 56th Timberwolves reunion in Atlanta August 28 to September 3, 2001. (The unit's final reunion will be September 1 in Chicago.) At the Atlanta reunion, I had a chance to relay Dad's appreciation of the infantry to several of the veterans I met -- and I listened as many of them talked about their experiences. The memories were old, but the tears were fresh. One told me, ""Think of the worst you could go through -- then double it."" Another said he wrote down his story but hid the manuscript in a safe</s>","Vets in D.C. today for kickoff of HBO series ""The Pacific"" made John DeDakis think of his dad. His father saw carnage during WWII stint as an officer serving in Europe, he says. As DeDakis taped his father's war recollections, his normally placid dad became emotional.

"(CNN) -- Running at full speed since the summer, a lab with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, testing blood samples collected by American hospitals on patients they suspected of having Ebola, has returned a negative result in every case. Until Tuesday. Some public health officials are explaining the first confirmed case of the Ebola virus in the United States, found in a man in Dallas, as a predictable event. But at least for this case, there are many questions surrounding that assertion. Were crucial procedures that might have prevented the victim--who Liberian officials have identified as Thomas Eric Duncan, according to an article in the New York Times--from arriving in the United States not in place? Have errors and missed opportunities put a handful of Dallas residents at risk of an infection, with a roughly 50% fatality rate? As the facts roll out about Duncan, who is fighting for his life in Presbyterian Hospital Dallas' critical care unit, we should scrutinize the travel screening procedures in use in the United States and the apparently myriad ways Ebola patients can slip through the cracks, even in one of the world's most advanced medical systems. We know that airport screening efforts, such as they are, failed. Duncan, traveling from the Ebola-ravaged city of Monrovia, boarded a plane bound for Dallas on September 19 after passing a screening that would have consisted of a few questions about symptoms and measurement of his body temperature. The effectiveness of the answers to screening questions depends entirely on the good faith we hold in the traveler's truthfulness. As evidenced by numerous flights of returning aid workers and journalists, recent Ebola contacts do not bar re-entry. Reports now indicate Duncan had such a contact. Since infected Ebola victims will remain asymptomatic for up to 21 days, does the screening procedure match up with the science? In Tuesday's CDC briefing, Dr. Thomas Frieden, the Centers' director, disclosed that Duncan left Liberia to visit family members living in the United States. We deserve more detail, because this choice is another possible point of intervention. Are hops from this stricken region to destinations across the Atlantic for vacation and family get-togethers reasonable at this moment? Should travelers be required to describe a compelling reason to visit the United States, when their choice to do so potentially affects others? Your questions answered. I feel greatly for the quarantined Dallas ambulance drivers and other community contacts whose lives are now upended as they wait in quarantine away from work life, income, and all other activities for three weeks. But it goes beyond lax screening: There is no effort to follow-up with potentially infected travelers after they arrive and begin circulating in America. If checking in with a nurse via telephone every few days for three weeks sounds too expensive, why not charge an entry fee to cover that cost? Ebola is a novel threat. It's time we think outside the box. Beyond these screening and surveillance problems, critical medical errors have compelled the CDC to dispatch a team of epidemiologists and crisis control specialists to augment Texas public health resources. The mistakes that brought us to this point reveal the fragility of our much-vaunted American health care system when it comes to anything out of the ordinary. As a physician I can empathize with the emergency room providers at Presbyterian who discharged their patient after an exam on September 26 with a course of antibiotics that are useless for his actual diagnosis. And it appears a nurse did inquire about recent travel, and Duncan volunteered that he was from Liberia. But in a story all too common where medical errors are concerned, Presbyterian hospital admitted on Wednesday that this information was ""not fully communicated"" to all the emergency room practitioners caring for him.

Manchester United signing Ander Herrera offered a display full of promise in his side’s 7-0 evisceration of LA Galaxy on Wednesday and the statistics reveal that the Spaniard is sure to provide an upgrade on the midfielders that toiled with such difficulty under David Moyes last season. In the dominant victory in Louis van Gaal’s first match in charge of the club in Los Angeles, Herrera earned the man-of-the-match award after a performance of poise and creativity in the United midfield, linking up almost telepathically with his compatriot Juan Mata. Albeit against admittedly mediocre opposition, Herrera enjoyed an encouraging debut, creating three of United’s seven goals as he played the full 90 minutes. Brilliant start: Ander Herrera appears to be the creative spark Manchester United sorely lacked last season. New star?

He lives in Edinburgh with fiancée Kornelia Chitrusko, 27, and will compete in a cycling event in the Games. JJ says:. ‘When I woke in hospital in Birmingham ten days after the attack the problem was that while I was intact, nothing worked: the blast crushed my face, broke my neck, injured both legs and smashed my arms to pieces.’ Scroll down for video. John 'JJ' Chalmers, 26, was serving in Afghanistan as a Marine Reservist when he was improvised by an improvised explosive device (IED) in May 2011. Doctors saved JJ’s right arm — from which a large chunk had been gouged — by using skin from his midriff. They cut open his abdomen and folded the loose flap of skin over his arm before sewing it in place inside. ‘It was like a sling created out of my own skin,’ JJ explains. The damaged arm remained there for six weeks, attached to the blood supply of the abdomen. ‘Over the weeks they cut small sections of the flap away and each time, my body learned to pump more blood directly into my arm, and a bit less to it through my abdomen. At the end of it, they separated them completely, and the wound on my arm is covered with skin from my abdomen.’ I lost three limbs but cycled to Paris. Josh Boggi, 28, Corporal (rtd) 9 Parachute Squadron, Royal Engineers lost his legs and his right arm when he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan. He lives in Salisbury with girlfriend Anna, 27. He says:. ‘I’d done three tours to Afghanistan when I stepped on an IED on New Year’s Eve 2010.

"AFC Wimbledon goalkeeper James Shea would love to follow in Dave Beasant's footsteps by making an impact against Liverpool - but remarkably admits to not having seen his penalty save from the 1988 FA Cup final. Monday will be a special occasion for everybody associated with the Dons, who are in the FA Cup third round for the first time since their rebirth in 2002. Player trials on Wimbledon Common and Combined Counties League football seems an awful long time ago now, though, with the club chasing promotion from League Two and readying themselves for a mouth-watering clash with Liverpool. AFC Wimbledon keeper James Shea is hoping to emulate Dave Beasant's performance against Liverpool. Wimbledon goalkeeper Beasant dives to save John Aldridge's penalty in the 1988 FA Cup final at Wembley. The Kingsmeadow encounter brings with it memories of the most famous day in Wimbledon's history, when the Crazy Gang shocked the Merseyside behemoths to win the FA Cup. Lawrie Sanchez scored the decisive goal at Wembley that day, although captain Beasant's save from a John Aldridge penalty remains the iconic image - one current Wimbledon goalkeeper Shea admits he has yet to see. 'I haven't seen the save but I've heard it is unbelievable,' he said. 'I remember (former AFC Wimbledon manager) Dave Anderson telling me about it when I was about to join. 'He talked me through the whole history of the club and everything, but I haven't had the chance to see it yet. 'I've been meaning to see the Crazy Gang documentary as well, but I don't have BT Sport. My old man has recorded it for me so I've got to go around his and watch it.

'I've seen (other) videos, I've seen the goal and inside the stadium there are pictures everywhere. 'It was a great day for them. They weren't expected to win and hopefully we can replicate what they done.' Beasant will be amongst the 4,800 crammed into Kingsmeadow on Monday and, given his own career started with non-league Edgware Town, he will appreciate Shea's journey to AFC Wimbledon. The 23-year-old came through the ranks at Arsenal, where, alongside the likes of Jack Wilshere, he won the 2009 FA Youth Cup against Liverpool. Shea progressed to the first-team and was on the bench for five Champions League matches during the 2012-13 season - what proved to be his last campaign with the Gunners. The Islington-born goalkeeper was released and dropped into non-league with Harrow Borough, leading him to seriously consider a future out of the game.

"Greg Dyke has made a confused, faltering, ego-stricken start to his stint as FA chairman but he has taken a positive step in the right direction with proposals aimed at bringing more and better youngsters to the aid of England’s ailing national team. Stricter limitations on foreign imports and a prohibition against the big clubs signing players by the bucket-load and immediately farming them out on loan would create Premiership opportunities for home-grown talent. A pity, then, that this initiative has coincided with a faltering start to the Champions League by England’s leading clubs. Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski hold their heads after Arsenal's defeat by Borussia Dortmund. With Arsenal and Manchester City losing at Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich respectively and Chelsea held at home by Schalke, our only winners this midweek were Liverpool. And they needed a last-gasp penalty from Steven Gerrard to struggle past a team nobody here had heard of until last month and whose name few of us can pronounce. These ragged showings are likely to set up another raft of over-priced buys from abroad when that transfer window creaks open again in January. Even if their Euro-results improve in the meantime, they have been warned as to how difficult the Germans will be to beat when it comes to the sharp end of the Champions League in the new year. Since the answer to that threat will not be to bring on young English talent, do not expect the Premier League to be encouraged by its biggest paymasters to accede to Dyke’s reforms. Do not expect, for example, Chelsea to be forced to rein back on their 26 – yes, 26 – players currently being borrowed by other clubs here and on the Continent. Dyke made a pompous ass of himself when he declared that England would not bid for any future World Cup while Sepp Blatter is still president of FIFA but he is right to highlight the abuse of UEFA’s transfer system. But is it likely to make much difference? Not while the giant clubs effectively run our national game for their own selfish ends.

Arsene Wenger admits ‘it would have been a paradox’ if Arsenal had taken their couple of half chances in Dortmund and deprived Borussia of a deserved victory. You have to love him, managing in his second language as he does. Arsene Wenger is stoney-faced as Arsenal are beaten in Dortmund. Yes or No, Blatter knows home nations back him on TV referrals. It seems that fooball was the only element of the United Kingdom in a win-win situation as Scotland voted on the independence referendum. If we are waking up to a Yes on Friday morning, it will be an end to the pressure from the wider football world for Britain, England included, to field a combined team in World Cups.

The days and nights had been long; everyone else, as darkness turned into dawn, looked wrung out and worn down and weary. She just glowed. ""Morning!"" she would say, flashing that zillion-watt smile, greeting each of us by name. ""Morning, Farrah,"" we would say back, feeling gray and dull in her presence.

That much I can tell you, from my limited time with her as she made that movie. She did her best to try to make the people around her forget just how all-reaching her fame was. There is a stratum of renown that is separate from the variety that accrues to most performers; Michael Jackson, who died on the same day as she, knew that type of renown, and so did she. Regardless of the role, she was always destined to be, in the eyes of the public, Farrah. That had to have been both a blessing and an encumbrance. Most people in show business would do just about anything to possess that level of connection with the people out in the seats -- to move through life having everyone in the world feel they know you. It must be difficult, though, to bury yourself in a fictional part when, inside, you are resigned to the idea that, to the unseen ticket buyers in the darkness, you are, now and always, Farrah. Any person with whom she had contact, however brief, would remember it for years. She understood that. She was golden, literally; it was her calling card. At breakfast, on the mornings she would join the crew, we would sit around long wooden catering tables, and there was a what's-wrong-with-this-picture aspect to the scene. These were mundane meals, and she was anything but. Or that's what we thought. Farrah? She was just getting ready to put in a day's work. The movie itself -- it was called ""Funny About Love""-- turned out to be quite forgettable. The male lead was played by Gene Wilder; the three women in his life were played, as the script was written, by Christine Lahti, Mary Stuart Masterson and Farrah. Everyone on the set seemed to get along, but what do I know? I'd never been on another set. After a lifetime of grunted hellos from assistant city editors, this was quite a change. Those dawns on the desert, those cast-and-crew breakfasts, those ""Morning!""s from Farrah as she strolled across the grass. Steve Allen, a luminary in the early days of television and a cogent observer of the world around him, said that when people see a person who is regularly on TV, it is as if the television performer emits a glow. The glow is invisible, yet it's there. And when a person who once was constantly on television suddenly isn't on television anymore, Allen said, it is as if the glow evaporates. It's gone.

"(CNN) -- Troubled U.S. insurer AIG will end its shirt sponsorship deal with Premier League and European champions Manchester United next year. End of era: AIG will not renew its four-year sponsorship deal with Manchester United. It was widely believed that AIG would not renew their £19 million ($27 million) per year shirt deal when the four-year contract expired in 2010, due to the financial troubles the company has suffered. And, on Wednesday, the company confirmed this. ""AIG's shirt sponsorship with Manchester United runs through May 2010. We have no plans to renew the deal,"" said a company statement. AIG is still restructuring after receiving a bail-out of $150 billion from the U.S. Government. They also have a £5 million ($6.8 million) per year deal to run MU Finance, but it is not clear what will happen with that contract.

"By. John Stevens. When the Chinese premier visited London this week he was greeted with an honour guard, a Downing Street reception and a meeting with the Queen. But one aspect of Li Keqiang’s welcome fell somewhat short in the eyes of Chinese officials – the red carpet rolled out for his arrival at Heathrow. After plans for Mr Li’s visit were shown to the Beijing government, aides complained that the carpet leading from the steps of his plane was not long enough. Scroll down for video. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, being given a guard of honour at the Treasury building in London. On his arrival at Heathrow he is said to have complained the red carpet was too short. ‘They saw a diagram of the arrangements at Heathrow and complained that the carpet was three metres too short,’ said one of the visit organisers. The objection was raised with Ed Llewellyn, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, but he is said to have told the Chinese official he had other things to worry about. ‘He said that he was sure the carpet would meet their requirements,’ the visit organiser told the Financial Times. Mr Li is said to have demanded to meet the Queen, who welcomed him to Windsor Castle, despite the fact that it is relatively unusual for her to receive world leaders who are not heads of state. During the visit, she welcomed him to Windsor Castle where they were joined by the Duke of York in the White Drawing Room. Later he went to Downing Street for lunch with the Prime Minister and business leaders where he was served a Chinese-themed menu including claypot chicken in a savoury sauce with shiitake mushrooms. During the visit, the Queen welcomed him to Windsor Castle where they were joined by the Duke of York in the White Drawing Room. One of China’s Communist-controlled newspapers was said to be so angry about the furore about whether Mr Li would be hosted by the Queen that it wrote an editorial in which it called Britain an ‘old, declining empire’ that resorts to ‘eccentric acts’ to cover its waning importance. China’s Foreign Ministry yesterday played down the diplomatic row over the length of the red carpet. A spokesman said: ‘The British side closely co-ordinated with the Chinese side in the reception organisation and visit results, took the initiative in making considerate arrangements and made great efforts to ensure the full success of Premier Li’s visit.

"By. Alex Ward. PUBLISHED:. 09:57 EST, 21 September 2012. |. UPDATED:. 07:51 EST, 22 September 2012. An oil painting bought at a golf club auction for £3,700 is believed to be a long lost work by famous painter JMW Turner worth up to £20million. Convinced the small painting was done by Britain’s most loved painter, art investor Jonathan Weal made sure he had the winning bid at the auction eight years ago. Now historians and scientists are backing up his claim after tests dated the oil on panel to 1805 and a handwriting expert verified the signature on the work was Turner’s. Long lost Turner: An art investor bought this oil on panel entitled. Fishing Boats In A Stiff Breeze at a golf club auction for less than. £4,000 which experts now believe is a JMW Turner painting worth up to. £20million. Art insurers Hiscox are said to have put the multi-million pound valuation on the masterpiece, entitled Fishing Boats in a Stiff Breeze. Mr Weal came across the 13in by 10in painting at the auction in Wealden, Kent in 2004 where amazingly it was even catalogued as a Turner, even though it had a reserve price of just £700 to £900. He said: ‘I eventually had to go up to £3,700, four times the estimate, so there must have been some others in the audience who suspected it was seriously valuable. Same Turner time: Scientific dating tests found that the mystery painting was from the same year Turner painted his famous masterpiece The Battle of Trafalgar, pictured. ‘I always back my judgement. ‘My. mother was an antiquarian bookseller, and she used to take me to the. Victoria and Albert Museum regularly, so I have always been interested. in art.’ Scientific tests date the painting,. inscribed on the panel along with the title, from the same year Turner. painted his famous The Battle of Trafalgar. Turner is considered to be the artist who made landscape paintings as important as historic paintings. And while he is renowned for his oil paintings, Turner is also considered one of the greatest masters of British watercolour landscape painting. Britain's best: Turner, pictured in self-portrait, is considered to be the artist who made landscape paintings as important as historic paintings. Turner scholar Dr Selby Whittingham. is among six experts who will present support evidence at a conference. at the Dulwich Picture Gallery in south London next Wednesday. Mr Weal said: ‘Turner spent a lot of time in Ramsgate and I believe. he painted it at a spot between Ramsgate and Broadstairs, funnily enough. an area where Nelson used to pick up a lot of his men to go to sea. ‘It is of great historical importance because we believe Turner gave the painting to his great friend the Reverend Trimmer, who was with him at his death and became his executor.’ Mr Weal believes that after Henry Scott Trimmer’s death the painting was sold in 1860, passing through several hands until disappearing from public view, until now. Dr Whittingham said it is unlikely to be a fake for many reasons. He said: ‘It seems unlikely to be a fake on various grounds. No one appears to have made any money out of it, so what would have been the point? ‘It is an oil painting as well, and. most of the Turner fakes have been of his watercolours. And tests on the. pigments used date it to about the right time to make it authentic. ‘This does not prove a particular artist was responsible but it helps to rule out forgeries from a later time. ‘I</s>","Art investor Jonathan Weal bought the oil on panel at an auction for £3,700 in 2004, convinced it was a long lost JMW Turner painting.

"PUBLISHED:. 12:24 EST, 6 February 2014. |. UPDATED:. 18:25 EST, 6 February 2014. No need to get the violins out for the owner of a rare Stradivarius that was thought lost - it appears to have been found. Police in Milwaukee say that the rare. multi-million dollar Stradivarius stolen from a concertmaster last month. has been recovered in Milwaukee. Authorities are working to confirm the violin is the one stolen from Frank Almond. in a brazen attack outside Wisconsin Lutheran College in Milwaukee January 27. 'It has to be confirmed. as to the actual authenticity of what it is,' said Lt. Jeffrey Norman. Police will contact experts to provide that confirmation, Norman said. He did not comment on the condition of the recovered violin. Scroll down for video. Loss: Frank Almond, right, had just finished a concert when he was attacked by a robber who stole his violin. Rare: The Lipinski Stradivarius, crafted in 1715, was on permanent loan to the concertmaster. Prosecutors confirmed Wednesday that. three people have been arrested in connection with the theft.

"(CNN) -- On a cold December evening, the green and white of Celtic were demolishing the red and gold of Motherwell and extending their lead at the top of Scotland's Premier League. At the same time, a few hundred of their fans were demolishing seats, throwing green smoke bombs onto the pitch and extending their reputation for notoriety. For Celtic's management, it was the final straw. They banned 128 Celtic supporters from attending future home matches and coach Neil Lennon bemoaned the ""powder keg"" atmosphere generated by a group of fanatical followers called the Green Brigade. There are passionate soccer supporters the world over, the sort who name sons after their clubs' stars or travel hundreds of miles on a wet Tuesday evening. But Celtic's Green Brigade brings a sectarian flavor to its support for Glasgow's Catholic club. In fact, it's more than a flavor -- though its members have described themselves as ""anti-sectarian."" This week Celtic went before the disciplinary committee of European football's governing body UEFA for the seventh time in as many years. The latest infraction: the Green Brigade had unfolded huge pictures of a Scottish nationalist hero, William Wallace, and more controversially of Irish Republican Army hunger-striker Bobby Sands before a recent game against AC Milan. Above the portraits, the slogan: ""The Terrorist or the Dreamer."" UEFA punishes such behavior, ""particularly messages that are of a political, ideological, religious, offensive or provocative nature."" It holds clubs responsible for the actions of its fans -- whether signs, chanting or throwing pyrotechnics. Celtic was fined 50,000 euros and responded by asking all its fans to ""unite with the Club"" with no more such banners. Celtic is one half of the most famous -- and at times infamous -- rivalry in British football. Its old enemy Glasgow Rangers has Protestant affiliations and for many years had a policy of not buying Catholic players. Submerged in debt, Rangers fell on hard times. Now the club -- resurrected as a new company but still featuring its predecessor's team manager and several of its players -- is in the lower reaches of the Scottish League. But in the past the two Glasgow clubs' epic battles for supremacy have been accompanied by provocative anthems, sectarian songs, violence and even deaths among supporters. There was a time when a club's directors would see such behavior as part of the fans' identity with a cause or heritage. Football in Europe grew up in the slums of industrialized cities, generations before the term ""politically correct"" was born. Glasgow Celtic was founded to provide charity to Irish Catholics who had fled famine for work in Scotland. And religious identity was a mooring in an alien land. Similarly in Liverpool, where one in four inhabitants in the late 19th century was of Irish origin, Everton FC was run by Liberals supporting Home Rule for Ireland while Liverpool FC was dominated by Protestant and Unionist figures. Today club football is big business with sponsors paying millions to have their names on stadiums and shirts, and top players earning six figures a week. Consultancy Deloitte calculates that the 20 richest clubs (all in Europe) generated more than $6 billion in revenues in 2011/12. A club like Celtic which competes in the European Champions League wants to attract international stars regardless of how or whether they were baptized. Getting into constant trouble with the European football authorities doesn't help. The fines are minimal; it's the damage to reputation that puts off sponsors. After the Bobby Sands incident, Celtic's chief executive,Peter Lawwell reminded fans that Celtic was ""a top football club in fantastic shape, aiming to play its part as</s>","A group of Glasgow Celtic fans lands the club with a fine after displaying banners at games. The ""Green Brigade"" contravened rules against ""provocative"" religious and political messages. Celtic has banned more than 100 fans from attending games and calls on supporters to unite.

"West Virginia's water crisis won't end any time soon, officials said Saturday. Testing must be completed to determine whether chemicals from a leak are still contaminating the water system in nine counties in the southwest section of the state, West Virginia American Water President Jeff McIntyre told reporters Saturday. That means the do-not-use order issued Thursday won't be lifted for days, he said. Some 300,000 West Virginia residents, in the meantime, still won't be able to use tap water to wash hands, brush teeth or take showers. They're being urged to watch for symptoms of exposure to the chemical, such as skin irritation, nausea, vomiting and wheezing. Homeland Security is trucking in 16 tractor-trailer loads of bottled water to help. The water restrictions were imposed Thursday when it was discovered about 7,500 gallons of a chemical used to clean coal -- 4-methylcyclohexane methanol -- had leaked out of a storage tank located a mile upriver from the water plant. The medical impact was hard to assess. ""We've had a lot of worried-well calls,"" said Dr. Rahul Gupta, of the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department. He cited complaints of irritation of the skin, throat, chest and stomach that some residents have linked to possible exposure to the chemical. The unknowns make residents anxious. ""They don't even know what the health risks are,"" Stacy Kirk of Culloden told CNN affiliate WSAZ. ""We had bathed, cooked and everything right before the news came on yesterday."" ""I don't know anything about the chemical to say too much good or bad about it, so we're all up in the air,"" said Arthur Taylor. ""We're common folks -- we're not chemists."" Anxiety about effects of chemical. Water company spokeswoman Laura Jordan urged people to get medical attention ""if they are feeling something... isn't right."" Many -- perhaps too many -- did just that. ""Our emergency rooms have been very busy with individuals unnecessarily concerned and presenting no symptoms,"" said the Charleston Area Medical Center. Karen Bowling, secretary of the state's Department of Health & Human Resources, said 73 people had reported to emergency departments, but that only two had been admitted to hospitals. ""That's really a very small number of patients that have been impacted by this,"" she said. Dr. Robert Maha, chief medical officer for MedExpress, a group of seven medical clinics in the area, said a large number of patients are seeking treatment for symptoms they worry are tied to the chemical exposure. He said the water crisis may contribute to the spread of flu, since people are having a difficult time finding clean water to wash their hands. ""That's one of our biggest concerns for the community,"" Maha said. Officials will know that the water is safe for more than firefighting and toilet flushing -- its only sanctioned uses now -- when tests find less than 1 ppm of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol in treated water, McIntyre said. Four laboratories have been set up to measure the levels in a uniform manner. ""The treatment plant must consistently produce samples at or below this level before the current do-not-use order is lifted,"" McIntyre said. He said there was an inadequate number of sampling results to report current levels. Authorities planned to take 100 water samples on Saturday night and have them processed on Sunday, Maj. Gen. James Hoyer of the West Virginia National Guard said at a Saturday night press conference. Though the water woes since Thursday have led scores of businesses to close, Gupta said that some restaurants were reopening after devising alternative plans. The problem affected people of all ages.

"What really happened to Michael Brown? We know a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, fatally shot the 18-year-old, but police and witnesses have given different accounts of what happened in the moments before the shooting. The confusion has fueled protests in Ferguson and, strong police response in the streets of the St. Louis suburb. Here are five key questions about the incident:. How did it start? Brown and Dorian Johnson, 22, were walking in the middle of the street, en route to either Brown's grandmother's house (according to Brown's mother and grandmother) or to Johnson's house (according to Johnson), when a Ferguson police officer confronted them. The officer told the young men either ""Get the f*** on the sidewalk"" or ""Get the f*** out of the street,"" according to Johnson's accounts to CNN and other news outlets. The young men replied that they were ""not but a minute away from our destination, and we would shortly be out of the street,"" Johnson told CNN. The officer drove away but stopped and backed up, almost hitting the pair, Johnson said. He said he wasn't sure what prompted the officer to return. Johnson told MSNBC the officer said something to the effect of ""What'd you say?"" ""We were so close, almost inches away, that when he tried to open his door aggressively, the door ricocheted both off me and Big Mike's body and closed back on the officer,"" Johnson said. Was there a struggle? Yes. Everyone agrees on this point, and it's one of the few aspects of the shooting that police have attempted to detail, though the official explanation has spurred many questions they have yet to answer. The preliminary investigation showed that the officer tried to exit his vehicle, but Brown pushed him back into the car, ""where he physically assaulted the police officer"" and struggled over the officer's weapon, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said. A shot was fired inside the police car, Belmar said. After the incident, the officer was taken to an area hospital, where he was treated for a ""swollen face,"" according to Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson. The story doesn't jibe with at least three witness accounts. Johnson claims the officer grabbed Brown by his neck, and Brown tried to pull away, but the officer kept pulling Brown toward him, he said. The officer drew his weapon, and ""he said, 'I'll shoot you' or 'I'm going to shoot' "" and almost instantaneously fired his weapon, hitting Brown, Johnson said. Witness Tiffany Mitchell was picking up coworker Piaget Crenshaw for their jobs when she saw Brown and the officer ""tussling through the window."" Mitchell and Crenshaw said Brown appeared to be trying to pry himself from the officer's grasp. Brown had his hand on the police cruiser, trying to push himself away, Mitchell said. Was Brown armed? No. Again, this is undisputed. Every casing found at the scene came from the officer's gun, Belmar said, and witnesses say that after the officer initially fired, the two young men took off running. ""I saw the officer proceeding after my friend, Big Mike, with his gun drawn, and he fired a second shot, and that struck my friend, Big Mike,"" Johnson said. ""And at that time, he turned around with his hands up, beginning to tell the officer that he was unarmed and to tell him to stop shooting. But at that time, the officer was firing several more shots into my friend, and he hit the ground and died."" This matches Crenshaw's and Mitchell's story. Crenshaw told CNN that Brown got about 20 feet away from the police cruiser before the officer shot him again. ""The cop gets out of his vehicle shooting,"" Mitchell said.

"Seven years ago, Steve Way was a 20 per day smoker and weighed a hefty 230 pounds (104 kilograms). On Sunday, he led the marathon competition against the best in the Commonwealth before finishing a creditable 10th place. Undaunted by the presence of defending champion John Ekiru Kelai of Kenya and a host of other athletes with faster personal bests, Way took the opportunity afforded by a tentative start by the race favorites to lead the bunch. Despite the effort, just a glimmer of a smile can be seen on the face of the 40-year-old, who was representing England after a strong showing in the London Marathon in April. Way admitted that as the Kenyans and eventual winner Michael Shelley of Australia surged he could not keep pace but his story continues to be an inspiration to all couch potatoes approaching a mid life crisis. He crossed the line after 42 kilometers in a personal best of two hours 15 minutes 16 seconds and still with a smile on his face despite toiling on a tough course around Glasgow in rainy conditions. ""Best day ever,"" Way said. ""I normally say it's second best to my wedding day but this one matches it. Sarah (his wife) won't mind I think. ""All my top goals -- top 10, PB, British vet record (for athletes over 40 years of age) -- and I've managed all three. I couldn't have wished for a better day."" Way finished a minute faster than his performance in London, where he was third British finisher behind Mo Farah and Chris Thompson and 15th overall. Regular training runs, sometimes up to 80km (50 miles), have seen him trim down to a lean 150 pounds as the fast food takeaways and a heavy alcohol intake have become a thing of the past. The marathon is not even Way's specialist distance. He will challenge for the world 100km (62 miles) championships in Doha, Qatar in November and with a personal best of six hours 19 minutes 19 seconds, that's six minute six second miles for the entire distance, has a realistic chance of gold. Shelley was winning the first athletics gold of the Commonwealth Games, improving on his silver from four years ago and with a personal best of two hours 11 minutes 15 seconds. Behind him, Kelai faded and his compatriot Stephen Chemlany took second with Abraham Kiplimo of Uganda in the bronze medal position. ""It is starting to sink in now,"" Shelley said. ""I dug deep and I was hoping I wouldn't blow-up like I have done in the past."" Later Sunday, the competition on the track began at Hampden Park, with the final of the men's 5,000m, despite the absence of the ill Olympic champion Farah, one of the highlights. It went to Kenyan Caleb Ndiku, the world indoor 3000m champion, in a time of 13 minutes 12.07 seconds to beat teammate Isiah Koech, with New Zealander Zane Robertson claiming bronze. The crowds at the Games will have to wait for the appearance of Usain Bolt, who has arrived in the Scottish city, but is not slated to run until next Friday's heats of the 4x100m relay for Jamaica.

"'The chip is changing my life': Tim Reddish with the silver medal he won at the 2000 Sydney Paralympics and the OBE he was awarded in 2009. He's won more than 50 medals swimming for his country, but Tim Reddish only ever had the pleasure of seeing a handful of them. Diagnosed with a degenerative eye condition at the age of 31, the former Paralympian went totally blind 17 years ago. But thanks to the fitting of a bionic eye, the 55-year-old can now see his haul in all its glory. Mr Reddish – currently the chairman of the British Paralympic Association – told yesterday how a revolutionary retinal chip is enabling him to make out shapes and read a clock face. The eight-hour procedure to implant an artificial retina brings hope to thousands who suffer with similar conditions. It costs up to £100,000 per patient and builds on previous attempts to produce a bionic eye using a camera and transmitter linked to a pair of glasses as a means of relaying images to the artificial retina. Mr Reddish is one of nine totally blind UK patients who took part in a trial of the chip at the Oxford University Eye Hospital and King’s College Hospital, London. He said of the moment medics switched on the chip: ‘It was as if a match had been lit in a dark room – it was unbelievable. ‘In the lab tests, when there are objects on a table, and the lighting is bright, I can tell you how many objects there are, and most of the time I can read the clock. 'To be able to see even the vaguest of blurry outlines of the medals I won is a terrific achievement and means a lot to me.’ Mr Reddish, from Nottingham, began losing his sight after developing retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disease that destroys the retina and which affects an estimated 20,000 in the UK. Scroll down for video. Artist's impression: Connected via a wire thinner than a human hair to a power supply just behind the ear, the chip is made up of 1,500 pixels, each with its own amplifier and electrode for stimulating the retinal nerves. The father-of-two competed at three Games with the British Paralympic swimming team. He scooped silver and bronze in 1992 in Barcelona, silver and bronze in Atlanta in 1996 and a silver medal in Sydney in 2000. He also won 11 gold world blind. swimming championships medals during an illustrious career, before. becoming performance director for the Paralympic swimming team at the. Athens and Beijing Games. He was honoured with an MBE in 2001. and an OBE in 2009, both for services to disabled sport. Last October,. medics inserted a 3mm square, light sensitive chip under the existing. retina in his right eye. Tiny: It is hoped that the 3mm chip could soon provide the 15million people left blinded by retinitis pigmentosa a means of partially restoring their vision. This X-ray image shows the position of the chip and its power supply in a patient's skull: When light enters the eye, the chip sends electrical signals to the optic nerve, which passes on the information to the brain. The chip is packed with 1,500. light-sensitive panels, producing a pixelated image which is boosted by. an ‘amplifier’, buried inside the head behind the ear. Each pixel mimics the function of the. photoreceptor rod and cone cells in the eye which were destroyed as a. result of Mr Reddish’s condition.

"Gay and lesbian rights advocates continued their undefeated run Thursday when a federal judge ruled Florida's same-sex marriage ban to be unconstitutional -- though he didn't go so far to allow such marriages as to take place right away. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle noted in his ruling that his is now one of 19 federal courts that have struck down state laws that bar gay and lesbian couples from marrying. While most of the time those decisions were put on hold as appeals work their way through the system, they have all reached the conclusion. Like those other judges, Hinkle said the Florida ban -- first put into law in 1977 and written into the state's constitution after a 2008 referendum -- violates the ""due process"" and ""equal protection"" provisions in the U.S. Constitution. His ruling applies both to whether same-sex couples can marry in Florida as well as to whether such marriages elsewhere should be recognized in the Sunshine State. ""The Florida provisions that prohibit the recognition of same-sex marriages lawfully entered elsewhere, like the federal provision, are unconstitutional,"" Hinkle writes. ""So is the Florida ban on entering same-sex marriages."" Yet his decision, while firmly in support of allowing same-sex marriage, won't take effect immediately. Hinkle's reasoning: It doesn't make sense to open up and allow such unions, only to have higher courts later reverse his decision and leaving some couples potentially in legal limbo. Judges hear four states defend same-sex marriage bans. Earlier this summer, state Circuit Court Judge Sarah Zabel wrote a similar ruling, based on a similar rationale. She, too, immediately stayed her own order ""pending the outcome of the expected appeal.""

"New York (CNN) -- The mother of a woman police identified as one of eight found dead on an isolated strip of waterfront property on Long Island, New York, told CNN that a man using the victim's cell phone made taunting calls and claimed he killed 24-year-old Melissa Barthelemy. ""Do you think you'll ever see her again?,"" the unidentified male caller asked Barthelemy's sister on August 26, 2009, according to Steve Cohen, an attorney for the victim's mother. ""You won't. I killed her,"" he added and hung up. The phone call ended after less than a minute. Another phone call was placed in July 2009 just days after Barthelemy disappeared. It was the first of seven calls he made from Barthelemy's cell phone. Cohen said that in the phone call the unidentified male caller referred to Barthelemy as a ""whore"" in a short conversation with her then-15-year-old sister. In the final call, the man described in graphic detail to the victim's sister what he had done sexually to Barthelemy, Cohen said. Barthelemy's mother and sister kept a journal of the calls that was turned over to police early in the investigation. The content of the calls could help police as they work to put together a profile of the suspected serial killer. Cohen described the man in the calls as ""a calculating, stone-cold killer."" ""He premeditated his acts,"" Cohen said. ""He knew what he was doing and my personal belief is that Melissa was not his first victim. He started to get good at this, and he's getting better at it."" Barthelemy was last seen alive in the Bronx Borough of New York and was later identified among three other bodies found on a quarter-mile stretch of waterfront property near Oak Beach, Long Island. The other three bodies have since been identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, of Norwich, Connecticut; Amber Lynn Costello, 27, of North Babylon, New York; and Megan Waterman, 22, of Scarborough, Maine. The remains of at least four other people have been found on Long Island but have not been identified in an investigation that stretches back to December. The grisly finds occurred as police searched for Shannan Gilbert, 24, who was last seen alive in May in the neighboring Gilgo Beach area. Gilbert has not been located. The massive search by police and federal agents in Suffolk and Nassau counties, where the human remains located so far have been found, comes two years after the alleged phone calls. Police said in January that calls from Melissa Barthelemy's cell phone had been traced to midtown Manhattan, with the two last calls made from around Madison Square Garden and Times Square. The caller hung up too quickly for authorities to pinpoint the exact locations of the calls, police said. The victim's family has described the calls previously, but only recently revealed the admission of guilt. The four victims who have been identified were all women who advertised prostitution services on websites such as Craigslist, police have said. Meanwhile, aviation teams flying over parts of Long Island had ""identified a significant number of items that aren't natural for the area,"" said Nassau County Acting Police Commissioner Thomas Krumpter. But as of Friday, authorities had not uncovered any further human remains. Earlier this week, police discovered skeletal remains -- including a human skull -- prompting the widening search. Police have not said whether the most recent remains are from different people, or if they could have come from the eight victims found previously. Airplanes and helicopters with high-resolution technology are being used in the search effort. The remains found Monday in a Nassau County wildlife preserve were wrapped in a ""black plastic product"" similar to a plastic bag, a law enforcement source said Wednesday</s>",The mother of a victim says a man called claiming he killed 24-year-old Melissa Barthelemy.

"Washington (CNN) -- Well, that turned ugly fast. A move that the White House hoped might herald a happy welcome home for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a soldier held captive for five years by the Taliban in Afghanistan, quickly turned into a nasty and largely partisan fight when he was exchanged for five militants being held in Guantanamo Bay. A political tsunami ensued with allegations from both sides of the aisle of politicizing national security, questions about whether Bergdahl is a deserter and criticism of his family. ""I'm never surprised by controversies that are whipped up in Washington. That's par for the course,"" President Barack Obama said Thursday during a news conference at a meeting of G7 leaders in Brussels. Surprising? Perhaps not. But the force of the vitriol, backlash and backpedaling is an example of how sensitive issues can quickly turn volatile in a hyper-partisan Washington climate, political analysts said. ""When, all of a sudden, you've got Republican congressman who previously were calling for this, criticizing the administration for leaving this man in captivity for five years, or praising his release, and then deleting those Tweets? That really belies the politics. That exposes the naked, ugly politics behind this controversy,"" said John Avalon, a CNN political analyst. Politics, raw and unpleasant, is what defines Washington now, political analysts said. ""It's to be expected because it's a potent mix of partisan environment where the rhetoric is very heated,"" said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. ""Combine that with a very controversial decision. Put those things together and you expect this kind of thing to happen."" However, it's important to wade through the rhetoric and get to the issues at the core, said David Rothkopf, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. Behind the ""the arm-waving and typical Capitol Hill vs. White House gamesmanship,"" there are pertinent questions about why the administration didn't tell Congress about the prisoner swap plan, if such a trade was a good one and whether the White House should have struck a more solemn tone about Bergdahl's release when there were questions about desertion, Rothkopf said. ""The Bergdahl situation has produced exactly the same kind of whirlwind of invective and overheated, highly politicized commentary that just about everything else does in Washington,"" Rothkopf said. ""The trick in this case, as in all others, is to somehow discount all that and get to the underlying truth. Real issues regularly get obscured by all the invective and defensive spin."" And everyone involved is in heavy ""defensive"" spin mode. Who was swapped for Bergdahl? I was for it before I was against it. Former Vietnam prisoner of war and 2008 GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain, criticized the trade of Bergdahl for the Taliban commanders quickly. ""This decision to bring Sergeant Bergdahl home, and we applaud that he's home -- it's ill-founded, it's a mistake and it's putting lives of American servicemen and women at risk,"" the Arizona Republican told reporters. However, in February, McCain seemed in an interview with CNN to back a swap. ""Obviously, I'd have to know the details, but I would support ways of bringing him home and if (an) exchange was one of them, I think that would be something I think we should seriously consider,"" he said at the time. McCain has said his message has been consistent. Then there are lawmakers who deleted their initial ""welcome home"" Tweets to Bergdahl as the controversy</s>",Rhetoric over Army Sgt.

An estimated five dozen Ku Klux Klan members turned out in downtown Memphis to protest the City Council's decision to rename three parks now named for the Confederacy and two of its leaders, CNN affilliate WMC reported. Some of them wore the group's traditional white robes, while others were dressed in camouflage or black military-style fatigues as they took to the steps of the old Shelby County Courthouse on a rainy Saturday afternoon.

But the defending champions had to come from behind to claim the three points, Genoa leading 1-0 at the break after Rodrigo Palacio fired home following good work from Abdoulay Konko. However, Inter were a different side in the second-half and three goals in seven minutes completely turned the match around. The home side leveled in the 50th minute when Giampaolo Mazzini slotted home Maicon's cross and they took the lead a minute later when Samuel Eto'o converted a rebound after Goran Pandev's shot was fumbled by goalkeeper Eduardo. And Eto'o added his second goal just six minutes later with a superb individual effort, the Cameroon striker's 18th goal of the season. Goran Pandev made it 4-1 in the 68th minute, after being set-up by Eto'o and Wesley Sneijder, and Yuto Nagatomo netted his first goal for the club to complete the scoring. Mauro Boselli's late header proved little more than a consolation goal for the visitors. Meanwhile, third-placed Napoli lost more ground on the top two after being held to a goalless draw by lowly Brescia at the San Paolo, with coach Walter Mazzarri sent to the stands in the first half for arguing with the referee.

"Doctor Who has come under fire after a scene featuring stars Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman pulling out their hair sparked complaints from sufferers of a rare disorder. The BBC sci-fi show has been branded it 'insensitive' following a scene which left sufferers of trichotillomania 'upset' and 'uncomfortable'. Series eight began last Saturday with the new Doctor, Peter Capaldi, 56, and his co-star Jenna Coleman, 28. Scroll down for video. Jenna Coleman, who plays Clara Oswald (left), and Peter Capaldi (right) as Doctor Who at the beginning of the scene as he appears to scratch and rub his hands through his hair before pulling out a strand. Clara Oswald watches in surprise as the Doctor tugs at the strand in the first episode of the eighth series. Capaldi then reaches over and pulls out a strand from his co-stars head as she exclaims in pain. But the hour-long programme caused controversy at the half-way mark during a scene between the Doctor and Ms Coleman. Around 36 minutes in, the Doctor, who at the time was seen to be in an intense conversation with Clara Oswald (Ms Coleman), appears to begin to pull his hair out before then pulling out the hair of his co-star. After pulling her hair out he remarks to Clara 'it was the only one out of place, I am sure you would have wanted it killed'. Quickly after the short scene finished, sufferers of trichotillomania and Dr Who fans took to social media to slam the BBC for showing the scene which could be seen as a trigger to some people. Trichotillomania is an uncommon way of harming where the inflictor pulls their hair out. It’s classed as an obsessive compulsory disorder and can affect anyone. Unfortunately there is still no known cure for the life-long disorder. Rebecca Brown, 21, from Chelmsford, Essex, vlogs about life with trichotillomania and has criticised the BBC. As a result of her videos, Rebecca, pictured here in 2012 with bald patches from condition, has huge following. Rebecca, pictured left in 2009 and right as she is today, published a six-and-a-half year time-lapse video on her YouTube channel last year in the hope that it would help other people suffering from the condition. Popular video-blogger Rebecca Brown, 21, known as Beckie0, who has over 185,000 subscribers on YouTube and suffers from the condition quickly vented her anger online. In a YouTube video titled 'Triggered By Doctor Who' which has had almost 14,000 views, she said: 'I sat down to watch Dr Who to enjoy myself, I didn’t expect it to include triggering content. 'I just wasn’t prepared, when I know something is coming I can turn off or close my eyes but it is pretty hard when you are suddenly met with it unexpectedly.' Doctor Who fans slammed the BBC on social media saying scene could trigger trichotillomania sufferers. She continued to say how she then went online to voice her concerns, which were met with a mixed reaction from the Dr Who ‘fandom’ which she explained left her feeling 'frustrated'. Miss Brown, from Chelmsford, Essex, who stated she 'loves Dr Who' added: 'I was just getting frustrated about how many people misunderstood where I was coming from. 'I don’t think people appreciated what it felt like for myself and others to sit in front of the telly watching them tear hair out, it just wasn’t right.

"By. Anna Hodgekiss. The first word their child speaks is a moment all parents remember. But for Steph Ward, it was a particularly emotional - because it meant her son had survived gruelling surgery. Four-year-old Lyall woke up from the operation and uttered his word ever word - ""mummy”. Scroll down for video. Brave: Lyall Cookward, 4, couldn't speak before surgery to reconstruct his windpipe. When he came round from the operation, his first word was'mummy' Lyall, who has Down’s Syndrome, suffered heart failure soon after birth and needed a risky operation - but was then diagnosed with a rare lung condition and spent six months in intensive care. He was expected to be on a ventilator long-term for life. But the youngster instead came off the machine, although he still relied on a tracheostomy opening his windpipe to help him breathe. This is a surgical procedure to create an opening in the neck at the front of the windpipe (trachea) - but it made it virtually impossible for Lyall to to speak. Although his airway had collapsed, Lyall’s surgeon suggested out he could carry out a full reconstruction. This involved grafting a piece of cartilage from Lyall’s rib onto his airway to strengthen it. Ms Ward and her partner Sharron Cook, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, agonised about whether he should have the risky surgery. Struggle: Before the surgery, it was expected that Lyall would be on a ventilator for life. But the youngster instead came off the machine, although he still relied on a tracheostomy opening his windpipe to help him breathe. Following surgery, he no longer needs this either. Ms Ward, a full-time mother, said: 'It was such a hard decision to make. Lyall was happy with his tracheostomy. He didn't seem to mind it at all. 'All the other operations he's had have been life-or-death, this one had to be our choice. 'Then we had to take into consideration the risks - the fact that the operation was taking place just milimetres away from his vocal chords, so we could lose what chance we had of hearing him speak. 'Also the operation could cause damage and affected his chance of eating properly. 'But we really wanted him to be free of the tubes and give him the chance to speak properly, to be able to communicate with his friends and play with them. 'Before, he wasn't able to get mucky like any other little boy because the tubes had to be kept clean.' The pair eventually decided to go ahead and he underwent the operation at Leeds General Infirmary last month. Thankfully, the surgery was successful. Ms Ward, 46, said: 'It’s amazing. When they told us he was now breathing, we just didn’t know what to say.' Happy: Lyall with his parents, Steph Ward and Sharron Cook. Ms Ward said: 'Hearing his first word was such an emotional moment. It was the perfect first word for him to say - and hearing it was amazing' Throughout his short life, Lyall has defied expert opinion as he has battled various serious health conditions. After the operation he had to be sedated in intensive care for several days to allow the graft to heal. She added: 'Lyall had the operation on March 13 and was sedated for three days to stop him from pulling on the tubes and allow the wound to heal. Then he got a chest infection and they had to keep him</s>","Lyall Ward has Down's Syndrome, heart and lung conditions. Was on a ventilator due to breathing problems and couldn't talk.

In the years before social media, people who were truly outraged would have to get a piece of paper, type a letter, put it in an envelope, stamp it and drop it in a mailbox. In contrast, today you can use your thumb to type a tweet on your phone and simply click ""Tweet."" Your rage is communicated to the world. Just this week, we saw instant outrage on full display in response to Seth MacFarlane's jokes at Sunday's Oscars. Amazingly, MacFarlane offended almost every group in America in one show. He was accused of being sexist, anti-Semitic, homophobic and racist. (It has to be an Oscar record.) Did Oscar organizers possibly hire MacFarlane to trigger our instant outrage for their own benefit? After all, they knew he'd say outrageous things. Any chance they wanted the public backlash to make the show, which has seen ratings woes in recent years, more relevant? (And ratings did rise for Sunday's Oscar telecast 11% in the coveted 18-49 age group.) Make no mistake: Our outrage has value. More recently, comedian Joan Rivers found herself the subject of outrage for a joke she made this week invoking the Holocaust. The media are now filled with people debating the ""important"" question: Did Rivers go too far? (Will the media ever stop asking that tired question about comedians' jokes?!) Instant outrage, however, is not just reserved for comedians; it crops up all over the news cycle. We saw it this week over Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's new policy banning telecommuting in the company she's been hired to revive, meaning people have to work from the office every day or quit. Twitter lit up: It's outrageous! It even happened to me last weekend when I was on CNN with anchor Don Lemon and playfully joked about Canada. Bingo! My Twitter feed was instantly filled with Canadians incensed that I had the audacity to poke fun at their beloved country. Just to be clear, I have nothing against Canada. In fact, it's my third favorite country in North America. There's so much more: Beyonce's halftime Super Bowl outfit; Hulk Hogan tweeting a photo of his daughter's legs; Kim Kardashian tweeting a photo of her diamond-encrusted gun; NBA star LeBron James wearing a T-shirt that some claim was about devil worship and/or a symbol for the illuminati. I get it. We all want to have our opinions heard. When we are mad about something, we want others to know about it. When we are offended, we want to call out the person who has offended us. I'm no different. But here's the thing: Why not also unleash our collective fury over issues more meaningful than just a comedian's joke or a celebrity's tweet? I'm not suggesting we ignore those -- because even if I did, no one would listen. But in addition to those, take a moment to express your powerful outrage over issues that might tangibly benefit your life and the lives of others. Let's get collectively angry that every nine seconds, a woman in the United States is assaulted or beaten. And let's get even angrier that three women a day in the United</s>","Dean Obeidallah: We live in a cultural era of instant outrage, fed by social media, news cycle. He says we inflate small things into big deals too easily -- jokes by Joan Rivers, Seth MacFarlane. He says we all get mad but why not about really outrageous things such as poverty, abuse.

I had seen the Labyrinth online and realised that I would pass it on my way to Barcelona. 'The woods were so thick you couldn't see the labyrinth at first, but then the structures appeared out of nowhere, towering above the tree line. 'The first thing you see is a long wooden tunnel made of bent and bound sticks, shooting violently up the side of a steep hill. To get to the top of the labyrinth you have to get inside the tunnel and climb your way to the top. You have to be pretty fit to make it up there.' Mr Wiper said he had to watch his step as he made his way up the hillside. He said: 'It felt pretty dangerous. Every time I stepped on a new rung of the ladder in the tunnel I could picture it breaking.'

It was almost like he had been practicing voodoo in there.' Mr Wiper spent two hours inside the labyrinth taking detailed photos of Mr Pujiula's work although sadly did not meet the man himself. Mr Wiper said: 'I didn't see him but apparently he is there most of the time continuing to build.

"Ibuprofen can make your lungs look younger - and could even help fight tuberculosis, researchers have found. New research shows that the lungs become more inflammatory with age. However, an Ohio team found that ibuprofen can lower that inflammation. Scroll down for video. An X-ray showing the lungs in a 16 year old healthy male. researchers say that Ibuprofen can make your lungs look younger - and could even help fight tuberculosis. The researchers gave old and young mice ibuprofen in their food for two weeks and then examined their lung cells. Old mice in the study were 18 months old – equivalent to about 65 in human years – and young mice were 3 months old, a similar age to human young adults. After this diet modification, several pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of old mice had been reduced to levels identical to those in the lungs of young mice, and the macrophages in old mouse lungs were no longer in a primed state. In fact, immune cells from old mouse lungs fought tuberculosis bacteria as effectively as cells from young mice after lung inflammation was reduced by ibuprofen. The ibuprofen had no effect on the immune response to TB in young mice. 'Very few researchers have linked inflammation to infectious disease in old age, even though TB in particular will drive that inflammation even further,' said Joanne Turner, associate professor of microbial infection and immunityat Ohio State and senior author of the study. 'The inflammation-associated changes that we saw in the lung were a small finding, but an important finding because the implications are great,' Turner said. 'We should be able to modify the environment in the lung. 'If we can reverse the inflammatory environment in a very straightforward way, that is a positive.' The research is published in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology. Though this line of work might someday support the use of ibuprofen as an adjunct therapy for elderly people with TB, researchers said they are not recommending use of the drug for the purposes of lowering inflammation. 'You can actually reduce your inflammation as you age by being lean, eating well and exercising. And we know that in the elderly, people who are fitter live longer,' she said. 'Inflammation is associated with sickness and frailty.' Though the research was conducted in mice, Turner co-led a previous study indicating that both mouse and human lungs develop the same profile of pro-inflammatory proteins and fatty molecules with age, creating an environment that impairs the immune response to infection. 'Essentially, ibuprofen made the lungs of old mice look young, Turner said. Researchers said they are not yet recommending use of the drug for the purposes of lowering inflammation. 'Putting young mice on ibuprofen had no effect because they had no lung inflammation, which implies the ibuprofen reduced the inflammation and changed the immune response in the old mice,' Turner said. 'It might be that ibuprofen works on specific pathways to lower inflammation, and that might help with control of TB.' More than 9 million people worldwide are estimated to have active TB infections, and about 1.4 million people die of tuberculosis each year. The researchers gave old and young mice ibuprofen in their food for two weeks and then examined their lung cells. After this diet modification, several pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of old mice had been reduced to levels identical to those in the lungs of young mice, and the macrophages in old mouse lungs were no longer in a primed state.

"It is the hardest thing about being on a diet - depriving yourself of your favourite foods. Now, one company claims to have come to the rescue - in the form of a low-calorie pizza. But before you get excited about carbs and cheese, bear in mind it's a meal replacement - made by adding water to a sachet of powdered dough and sauce. And while it's topped with vegetables, there is, sadly, no cheese. Scroll down for video. Slimline: The meal replacement pizza claims to have just 200 calories, thanks to a base made from vegetable protein and egg white that is topped with a tomato sauce. Tasty? The pizza are made by adding water to a sachet of powdered pizza dough and tomato sauce. The Exante pizza, it is claimed, has just 200 calories per eight-inch serving, compared with at least 500 calories in a regular thin crust base with tomato sauce. It is also said to be enriched with more than 22 vitamins and minerals plus added protein and is in line with recommendations of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). And the secret to it being just 200 calories? The dough is made from a vegetable protein and egg white and is topped with a tomato sauce containing soya and herbs. Eaten in its entirety as meal, it provides a third of the recommended daily amount of vitamins and minerals. While cheese wouldn't be recommended for dieters, other suitable toppings include green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, red onions - food low in carbs and calories. Chris Rogerson, managing director for the online weight-management company, Exante Diet, said sales in weight-loss meal replacements have rocketed in the last two years. 'Dieters want products that fit into their busy lifestyles,' he told MailOnline. Exante diet (per eight-inch pizza, dough and sauce) Calories 200. Fat (g) 4.9. Carbohydrates (g) 19.9. Protein 17. Leading brand. Calories 540. Fat (g) 19. Carbohydrates (g) 67. Protein 14. 'They also want to enjoy meals with their families and our new diet pizza allows them to stay on track with their weight loss without feeling deprived.' And unlike many meal replacement foods, it does actually resemble real food, he adds. But is a meal replacement pizza really the answer, regardless of what it may taste like? 'Meal replacements used to get a really bad press, but they do have a role to play,' dietitian Helen Bond told MailOnline. 'Most of them are required to have 200 - 400 calories by law and must contain an assortment of vitamins and minerals, added protein and fibre. 'Most people will lose weight if they cut down and will eat just 200 calories - and these meals are good for those who struggle with portion control.'

"She's one of the hottest new stars in Hollywood, who found herself firmly in the 'best dressed' Oscar lists after her appearance in a Saint Laurent dress and bold scarlet lips on the red carpet. Now Margot Robbie, 24, who wowed on Sunday with her new on-trend long, has admitted that trying 'on a whole lot of nice clothes' is one of the best parts of her job. In Focus, the Australian-born beauty wears a dazzling array of designer names including Gucci, Saint Laurent, Michael Kors and Givenchy and she describes the film as 'like playing dress up'. Scroll down for video. Margot Robbie wears head-to-toe designer clothes and accessories in con caper Focus. Margot shows off a clinging one-shoulder Roland Mouret dress in the con-artist caper with Will Smith (left) Margot says he lets the costume designers get on with their job and rarely offers her own suggestions; in one scene she shows off a Herve Lege halter neck bikini top (right) in the new film with Will Smith. She said: 'The costume choices are always pretty instrumental in creating your character so I was lucky that they were very open to any suggestions. 'Most of the time I just try to stay out of it or you end up dressing yourself and looking like yourself so it's better letting the people hired to do the job, do their job.' Playing Jess, a pickpocket who joins up with seasoned conman Will Smith for a huge heist, the Australian actress had to portray a thief pretending to be a wealthy woman. While many cinema-goers will catch the film to see if the chemistry between Margot and her co-star is as sizzling as rumoured, others will be captivated by her chic on-screen wardrobe, which is worth thousands. In one pool scene, she dons a sexy Herve Leger halter neck black strappy bikini, teamed with Prada platform sandals. A body-con floral-print white dress by Trina Turk is in one scene shot in Argentina, while the over-sized shades are Gucci. Margot plays pickpocket Jess who gets involved with a big-time con artist, and she said for the scenes filmed in Buenos Argentina (right), she wore form-fitting colourful dresses like this Trina Turk floral-print number. Margot also shows off her slim, toned physique in a red one-shoulder jersey dress by Roland Mouret along with Alexander Wang pumps. She said: 'The costume fittings for this were really fun because I got to wear cool clothes. 'The only input I had to my costuming was that I wanted there to be a difference between the first half and the second half of the movie looks for Jess. At the start of the film, Jess's look is'street, a little more edgy', said Margot, adding that she wears a 'leather jacket, nail polish that's kind of chipped, dark roots in her hair.

"Clearly inspired by Jesus' words 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you', a pair of Christian mixed martial artists knock each other out with simultaneous blows to their privates. Filmed for the now released 'Fight Church' documentary, the two fighters are part of the burgeoning Christian mixed martial arts movement that espouses the mantra, 'Jesus never quit, he never tapped out.' Indeed, the documentary, which was funded by $30,000 raised through crowd sourcing, attempts to answer the hard questions raised by combining religion and extreme physical violence, such as, 'Can you love your neighbor as yourself and at the same time knee him in the face as hard as you can?' Scroll Down for Video. Moment of impact: This is the sickening double knee to the privates from each fighter which leaves them both sprawled on the canvas. Pain: The two fighters are contorted in pain on the canvas after striking each other at the same time during a fight. Introducing themselves before the fight, one of the two men who knock each other expresses his desire to get closer to God during the brutal battle. 'The hope is that through the fight I can create a relationship with person I am fighting and Christ too,' says the fighter. 'If I win the fight its because God gave me that fight, it's not anything I have done.' 'Its already been decided who won. It's just you wait to find our what happens' After the unfortunate result, the fighter sits in the dressing room with a bag of ice cooling over his now battered privates. You'll be Okay: One of the MMA fighter's is left to struggle with his injury in the aftermath of the fight. His pastor and leading light in the evangelical mixed martial arts world, Paul Burress, blesses him. 'Dear God thank you for the win. Thank you for making (the fighter) him ok and still walking,' says Burress. 'I pray there is no damage, nothing swells up badly here (his testicles) and God I just thank you for the safety out there. Amen.' Focusing on Senior Pastor Paul Burress and his Rochester, New York, Trinity Church and its offshoot MMA school, Trinity Training, 'Fight Church' explores the contradictions inherent in fighting and organised Christianity. Senior Pastor Paul Burress at his Trinity Church in Rochester, New York, is an avid proponent of Mixed Martial Arts and evangelical Christianity. Theology student and Mixed Martial Arts expert Scott Sullivan (left) prays while Paul Burress preaches to his flock. 'In life there are times when you take shots cause its a battle out there and the enemy is trying to seek and destroy us,' explained Burress to his congregation in a scene from 'Fight Church'. 'He wants to destroy your families, he wants to destroy you personally. 'That's where the bible gives you your training. 'I love fighting.' Directed by Oscar winning short film-maker, Daniel Junge, 'Fight Church' travels the country to interview religious MMA figures. 'People may say, mixed martial arts is wrong, Jesus told everybody to turn the other cheek,' says 'Fight Pastor' Brandon Beals to the camera.

"By. Sarah Griffiths. A class of insecticide called neonicotinoids have already been proved to harm honeybee colonies. And now Dutch researchers have discovered that starlings and swallows disappear in areas treated with the chemical. It is the first time that scientists have directly linked a neonicotinoid called imidacloprid to the death of birds. Scroll down for video. Dutch researchers have discovered that starlings and swallows (pictured) disappear in areas highly treated with an insecticide called imidacloprid, which is a type of neonicotinoid already proven to kill off honeybees. Imidacloprid is the most widely used insecticide in the world. The class of neonictinoid insecticide has been linked to the death of 15 species of birds in the Netherlands. Scientists found that the higher the concentration of imidacloprid in the surface water studied, the greater the decline in bird numbers. Numbers of the birds studied decreased on average by 3.5 percent per year in areas with more than 20 nanograms of imidacloprid per litre. This concentration is greatly exceeded in many parts of the Netherlands. They noted that populations of 15 species of birds are declining in areas where farmers have treated their crops with imidacloprid. The experts looked closely at data on local bird population trends and environmental factors, which include imidacloprid concentrations in surface water, to come up with their findings, which were published in the journal Nature. It is the first study to correlate imidacloprid, which is the most widely used insecticide in the world, to possible indirect harmful side effects via the food chain, for birds. Ecologists at Radboud University Nijmegen and the Sovon Centre for Field Ornithology in the Netherlands, explained the trend by identifying concentrations of neonicotinoids in surface water in relation to other factors, such as land use. The higher the concentrations of the insecticide in the water, the greater the decline in bird numbers was seen. Populations of 15 bird species declined by 3.5 per cent on average in areas with more than 20 nanograms of imidacloprid (marked in white on the map) and other regions (marked in orange and red) had higher concentrations of the insecticide in the water. The focused their study on the starling and barn swallow, which are common in the area. Ruud Foppen from the Sovon Centre explained that the species are relatively easy to study because there is lots of data on them to analyse densities and trends in their numbers. Most of the birds forage around ditches, hedgerows and field margins to find the insects, which they eat. And many of the insects spend part of their life cycle in water, so the scientists measured the water quality taken by district water boards. They found that higher the concentration of imidacloprid in the surface water, the greater the decline in bird numbers. For the fifteen bird species that were included in the study, populations decreased on average by 3.5 percent per year in areas with more than 20 nanograms of imidacloprid per litre. This concentration is greatly exceeded in many parts of the Netherlands. Populations of birds are declining in areas where farmers have treated their crops with imidacloprid. A tractor spraying crops with insecticide is pictured. It is the first study to correlate imidacloprid, which is the most widely used insecticide in the world, to possible indirect harmful side effects, via the food chain, for birds such as the starling (pictured) Experts have previously proved that two widely used neonicotinoids - a class of insecticide – harm honeybee colonies over the winter, particularly when temperatures drop.

Children's nativity costumes are selling for more than three times their value on eBay as desperate parents struggle to find last minute costumes for nursery and school plays. Parents are frantically bidding against each other for shepherd, angel, wise men, Mary and Joseph costumes as supermarkets sell out of the dressing-up clothes. Used and homemade angel costumes are selling for up to an incredible £32 on eBay, whilst king costumes are going for more than £20 and shepherd costumes for up to £22. George at Asda is selling nativity costumes for £8 - including King, shepherd and sheep - but parents have found sizes sell out fast as time-poor parents buy instead of make their child's school nativity outfits. Traditional: Children from Little Downham primary school in Cambridgeshire show off their homemade outfits. Many of the outfits have been posted by savvy parents, who have snapped up bargains at supermarkets, such as Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's, where the costumes cost around £8 each. A lot of the nativity clothes have now sold out in the supermarket stores or on their websites, so prices are rocketing on eBay. 'We've only just been told that our son is a shepherd in the school play and most of the supermarkets have sold out of his size, so I've had to buy on eBay,"" said Catherine Wallis, 37, from Cambridge. 'It's very annoying when I could have bought a similar costume for less a third of the price a few weeks ago.' Hot property: An angel costume similar to those that sell for £8 in Asda recently sold for £24 on auction site eBay. A spokesman for eBay said sales of nativity costumes had shot up by 102 per cent over the last fortnight on eBay.co.uk. He said sales of nativity wear were also up 57 per cent compared to this time last year and there were currently 3,000 outfits listed on the site. 'This Christmas we've seen sales of nativity costumes shoot up as savvy parents have been flocking to the site en masse to get their children kitted out,' he said. A spokesman for Asda said there has been a 40 per cent increase in sales of single tea towels and its multi-buy five pack tea towels, which the supermarket has attributed to mothers making homemade shepherd headdresses. Harriet Oliver, 40, from Fulham, south west London, said: ‘I spent days trawling the internet looking for a King or Wise Man costume for my son, Rupert, who is six, to wear in his nativity play. 'I looked on every site I could think of but everything had sold out in his size – all I could find was one costume that was £40, which was far too much. 'I was desperate, and my son was horrifed at the prospect of me cobbling something together with my rusty sewing skills, but eventually a friend found him a brilliant costume at Asda. ‘Next year I will start looking earlier, but the schools don’t tend to tell you what part your child has until December anyway, so it’s always a rush.'

"(CNN) -- Life after ""The O.C."" has been rocky, to say the least, for Mischa Barton. The 27-year-old actress was one of the hottest TV stars out about a decade ago, but since her reign as ""The O.C.'s"" Marissa Cooper, Barton has had a ""full-on breakdown,"" she tells People magazine in its new issue. The actress recounted how, in July 2009, her parents and agents confronted her with their concern that she was working too hard and partying even harder. During the intervention, Barton blacked out and was sent to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Along the way, she threatened to kill herself, which prompted her being sent to a psychiatric ward for four days. ""It was a full-on breakdown,"" Barton said. ""It was terrifying. Straight out of 'Girl, Interrupted.' Story of my life."" The actress said she was never actually suicidal, just ""overworked and depressed. But one slip of the tongue in a heightened moment, and you find yourself in that situation."" Yet that situation also allowed her to gain some clarity about her life, she told the magazine. ""I was deeply hurt at first,"" Barton recalled, ""and then I accepted this was time I needed to be away from work, my family and all the pressure. I had been through the wringer."" The star also opened up about coping with the public's scrutiny of her weight: ""It was always, 'She's too skinny, she must be sick.' Then it was, 'She's too big.' I was never the right weight.""

"The alleged killer plunged the sharpened edge of the comb into the skull of Julie Sheriff. A young boy who witnessed the attack said it sounded 'like the noise it makes when we kill a goat back home' Police found a message on alleged attacker's phone admitting to a friend'she kind of stabbed' the victim. By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 11:20 EST, 16 July 2012. |. UPDATED:. 13:48 EST, 16 July 2012. A 15-year-old girl murdered a teenage rival with a steel afro comb because she spread gossip about her, the Old Bailey heard on Monday. The alleged killer is said to have plunged the sharpened end of the comb into the skull of policeman's daughter, Julie Sheriff, 16, after spotting her on her south London ‘territory’. Julie remained in a coma for 19 weeks following the attack but never regained consciousness and died in hospital on September 21 last year. Julie Sheriff was stabbed in the skull with an afro comb and was in a coma for 19 weeks following the attack and died in hospital on September 21 last year. Julie’s family moved to Britain in 2006 from Sierra Leone, West Africa, where Julie’s father, Raouf, was a police officer. Jonathan Turner, QC, prosecuting, said the two girls ‘actively disliked’ one another by the time of the attack on May 7. ‘What lay behind this antagonism, the crown cannot say with any certainty,’ he said. ‘But there seems to have been a row brewing between them over certain allegations that Julie had been making about the defendant, and some boyfriend or boyfriends of hers.’ He said the gossip had been spread via the mobile phone network using ‘telephonic sites’. The defendant, now 16, spotted Julie close to a William Hill betting shop in Falcon Road, Clapham, and angrily snapped: ‘What do you think you are doing in Clapham? Why are you here?’ Mr Turner said: ‘There seems to have been some territorial issue between them.’ Just moments after the chance meeting, the defendant was allegedly seen to thrust an overarm blow at Julie’s head. A boy who witnessed the attack described it sounding ‘like the noise it makes when we kill a goat back home’, the court heard. ‘He described [the 16 year-old] as. reaching into her bag and pulling out a pin-tail comb and stabbing Julie. with it not once but twice,’ Mr Turner said. ‘The first one was to Julie’s. collarbone, but it barely penetrated, and it was the second blow that. went into her making a noise, he said, like a noise it makes when we. kill a goat back home.’ Jurors heard a friend of the victim only saw one blow but did not notice a weapon. Scene: The attack is alleged to have taken place outside this south London bookmakers. Within seconds of the attack Julie was said to have complained of a sore head and collapsed against the side of the betting shop. At hospital a CT scan showed. ‘substantial swelling of the brain and internal hemorrhage deep with in. the brain,’ said Mr Turner. She underwent a series of operations without improvement before suffering a cardiac arrest 20 weeks later on September 21.

"Nissan has joined the raft of technology companies launching smartwatches - but instead of letting users do everything from taking photos to surfing the web, the car-inspired timepiece analyses the efficiency of a Nissan car. Few people had expected a car manufacturer to enter the smartwatch fray - which has seen Sony and Samsung launching high-profile watches last week, and many consumers eagerly anticipating an offering from Apple. The Nismo Watch connects drivers to their cars and provides data on both the car and its driver's performance. Scroll down for video. Nissan's Nismo Watch connects drivers to their Nismo cars and provides data on both the car and its driver's performance. The company claims its product, which was unveiled at the Frankfurt motor Show, is the first smartwatch to connect a driver with a car. The Nismo smartwatch monitors the car's efficiency, including the average speed and fuel consumption. It can access vehicle telematics and performance data, such as how smoothly a driver brakes and accelerates. The smartwatch also tracks a driver's heart rate with the help of a heart rate monitor. This. could be the first step in creating an accessory for drivers that in. the future could detect the first signs of fatigue to prevent accidents. The company claims its product, which was unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show and is aimed at 'petrolheads', is the first smartwatch to connect a driver with a car and is the company's initial step into wearable technology. While the watch is currently a concept, Nissan said it will monitor a car's efficiency, including the average speed and fuel consumption and track the driver's biometric data using a heart rate monitor. The watch can also accesses vehicle telematics and performance data, such as how smoothly a driver brakes and accelerates. Nissan has not revealed how much the Nismo watch will cost or when it could launch, but it will come in black, white and red, hinting that the concept will be put into production. It is designed to work with Nissan Nismo vehicles using a smartphone via a Bluetooth Low Energy connection.

"By. Mark Duell. and Richard Spillett. A payday loans firm sent more than 1,000 text messages demanding cash to a heavily indebted customer after he had killed himself, it emerged today. Ian Jordan, 60, of Botley, Hampshire, had racked up more than £20,000 of debt to more than 12 firms over a year before he committed suicide. In one case he was being charged more than 5,000 per cent a year in interest for the cash he had borrowed. His daughter, Samantha Carr, and her family have now posted a video online in memory of him, which includes a heartfelt call on the Government to clamp down on payday loan firms. She said: 'Ian received 1,000 texts after his death. Some of them were demands for money. They pursued the family too.' Relatives were so tormented by the aggressive texts, they ripped the SIM card out of Ian's phone to make them stop. Scroll down for video. Suicide: Ian Jordan, 60, had racked up more than £20,000 of debt to more than 12 firms. The video features photos from Mr Jordan's life cut alongside the heartbreaking story of the events which led to his death. The poignant messages read: 'My daddy's rubbish at maths. That's why he trusted those payday loan companies. But soon he was really worried and embarrassed. 'He didn't talk to anybody about his debts, but I wish he had, because then I wouldn't have to go to his funeral two weeks before Christmas.' It ends with a call on the Prime Minister to tackle the companies which the family say brought about Mr Jordan's early death. The video concludes: 'Get rid of these stupid high interest rates Mr Cameron... now. So that no other person feels alone and desperate like my daddy.' Football fan and darts player Mr Jordan was found dead at his £130,000 semi-detached home one week after he was last seen. The alarm was raised by his doctor when he missed several appointments. Huge debts: In one case Mr Jordan was being charged more than 5,000 per cent each year in interest for the cash he borrowed. The tribute video is made with a poignant commentary on Mr Jordan's tragic last days as he worried about debt. He had written a note on his laptop which officers found when they entered his home. And today his family urged the authorities to do more to halt the number of people falling into the debt trap. Mr Jordan had been unemployed for years due to poor health and suffered with a hiatus hernia. He was then taken off Jobseeker's Allowance but the loan firms still continued to take the cash. Ms Carr told the Daily Mirror that the firms sent him more than 1,000 text messages after his death, demanding repayments be made. After hearing how Mr Jordan had overdosed on prescription drugs, Grahame Short, Coroner for Southampton and the New Forest, recorded a verdict of suicide last week. Mr Short said: ‘The note makes it clear that he wanted to end his life. I was not aware of the level of his debt until today.’ Speaking after the inquest, Ms Carr said: ‘He was borrowing money to pay off debts [which was] to pay off debts. 'The interest rate is one thing, the fact that you have already got this debt was another. It just spiralled out of control.' The video, which has been posted on YouTube, features photos of Mr Jordan throughout his life. The tribute video concludes with a message to the Prime Minister, calling on him to tackle payday loan firms.

"Lights, camera, fashion. The New York Fashion Week action is afoot, with designers showcasing their spring 2015 collections this week and next, before heading overseas to London, Milan and Paris. See all of CNN Living's New York Fashion Week coverage. What will be sent down the runways, and ultimately into consumers' closets? Two fashion forecasters from WGSN, the official trend sponsor for the sleek affair, weigh in with their predictions. A strut down memory lane. As the fashion world looks to spring, designers will be looking back -- particularly to the 1970s -- for inspiration, according to WGSN's head of catwalk, Lizzy Bowring. If the prospect of a ""Saturday Night Fever"" renaissance seems less than groovy, Bowring assures the retro influence will be subdued. Caftan comfy, caftan chic. ""The idea is to get back into yesteryear but add a contemporary twist with a fresh modern appeal,"" Bowring says. Pants will take up a slight flare, and just as Diane Keaton notably catapulted menswear into the spotlight in 1977's ""Annie Hall,"" so will the fashion-forward in spring 2015. Bowring says one of the big themes will be a ""fuss-free approach of androgyny"": Think sleek, sophisticated jumpsuits and/or tailored jackets paired with relaxed wide-leg trousers. In a similar vein, Jaclyn Jones, WGSN's senior womenswear editor, forecasts that the basic white dress shirt, a wardrobe staple, will be transformed with more dramatic side vents and cuffs, origami folding, embellishments and the like. Jones also expects a sampling of tent dresses, sometimes referred to as trapeze dresses, to hit the catwalks. (If the garment were laid flat on a surface, its silhouette would gradually flare out from the shoulders and resemble the shape of a tent -- hence the name.) Both forecasters anticipate a continuation of longer hemlines with midi skirts (skirts that fall midcalf), as well as ankle-length wrap versions, with their waistlines falling at the natural waist versus the hip. While hemlines are lower, Bowring says there certainly will be no shortage of shorts, particularly of the Bermuda variety. Straddling that line is one of the most talked-about trends for spring: culottes, a wide-leg, airy, not-quite-shorts, not-quite-pants silhouette. Keeping it cool. Spring and pastels go together like April showers and May flowers. For 2015, those pastel tones will be washed out and desaturated. In keeping with that, there will also be a ""core neutral story,"" Jones says, with shades of tan, taupe, gray, white and black.

"New research focusing on underage Mexican immigrants trying to cross the border illegally into the United States shows these minors don't put aside their American dream easily, even if caught multiple times by immigration authorities. According to a new report published by the Pew Research Center, out of 11,000 Mexican minors who tried to cross the border illegally between last October 1 and May 31, ""only 2,700 children (24% of all the apprehensions) reported being apprehended for the first time in their lives."" This means that more than three-quarters of the children have been caught trying to cross the border illegally more than once. According to the report, 15% of these would-be migrants had been detained by immigration authorities and deported at least six times. Mark Hugo Lopez, Director of Hispanic Research at the Pew Research Center, said his team started analyzing the data with no preconceived notions. ""We had no sense of how many times young people from Mexico had tried to cross the border,"" Lopez said. ""In conversations with officials at the Mexican embassy we found out they had very specific data about the minors apprehended by immigration authorities, information that they have been collecting."" The data from Mexican officials was then checked against data collected by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and researchers found there was correlation. U.S. immigration authorities notify Mexican consular officials of apprehensions per agreements between the two nations. When it comes to reasons why these children are choosing to leave home, Lopez said poverty and increased violence are the two main factors. ""Most of these young children are coming from border states, particularly Tamaulipas (south of Texas) which accounts for more than one quarter (3,077) of all those apprehended,"" Lopez said.

"An athlete who spent a year training for a gruelling triathlon missed it - because he overslept. Jody George spent months taking donations and keeping friends up to speed on his preparation for the Challenge Weymouth Triathlon, which would have seen him swim 2.4miles, cycle for 112miles and then run a marathon. Mr George set his alarm for 3am, giving him plenty of time to drive to Weymouth Bay, Dorset, for the start. But the 34-year-old, who was due to be raising funds for Devon and Somerset Air Ambulance, after hitting snooze and not waking until 5.55am - far too late to make it in time. Scroll down for video. Jody George spent a year training for the gruelling triathlon in Weymouth only to oversleep and miss it entirely. Mr George, from Othery, Somerset, said the moment he realised he had missed the race was one of the worst of his life. He said: 'I set the alarm on my phone for 3am. It went off but I hit snooze, as I normally do. 'The only trouble was I hadn't switched on the snooze facility for the new time. I went back to sleep, and the next thing was the alarm going off at five to six. 'I held the phone in my hands and looked at the time for a while in disbelief. I knew instantly that was it. 'I was in total shock. I just went downstairs and made a cup of tea and said to my fiancee PJ, ""that's that, I'm not racing today"". 'She was the one shouting and swearing, I was in shock for days. 'It took me a good two or three days to recover emotionally to be able to even talk about it. 'I'm still quite upset with myself. I had to apologise to everyone who had supported me, who had sponsored me and donated. Mr George was forced to admit the embarrassing situation to his friends and family who had sponsored him hundreds of pounds for the challenge, but. 'I'd prepared for a year, I'd posted it all on Facebook, giving updates on the training, and everyone was following it and encouraging me. 'In fact, the last post the day before said that I felt quite relaxed about the race the next day - I was obviously a little bit too relaxed.' Mr George, a manager at a buildings maintenance company, was forced to admit the embarrassing situation to his friends and family who had sponsored him hundreds of pounds for the challenge. He wrote in a post on his JustGiving page: 'I would like to apologise to everyone that has sponsored me through this page. This morning I failed to start in the event and have let you all down. If you would like me to refund your donation, please let me know. I'm so sorry Jody.' Determined not to let his friends down, he recreated the triathlon near his home on the Somerset Levels.

"By. Steve Robson. PUBLISHED:. 11:36 EST, 26 December 2012. |. UPDATED:. 11:36 EST, 26 December 2012. A conman who racked up a £2,400 bill at a luxury hotel by posing as a professional rugby player was caught out because staff thought he was too fat to be a top sportsman, a court heard. Christopher Hoare, 30, registered at top Kent hotel Eastwell Manor under a fake name in October. He gave receptionists a fraudulent credit card number and claimed a fictional body called Sports England Training was picking up the tab. Christopher Hoare racked up a £2,400 bill during a six-night stay at the Eastwell Manor hotel in Kent before he was caught by police. But the hotel manager became suspicious when he wore the same outfit for several days running and noted his overweight appearance, Canterbury Crown Court heard. He called Natwest bank who advised the hotel to call police. Hoare, a gambling addict, was arrested by Kent Police and admitted false representation and theft. He was on the run after committing a string of offences from Cardiff to Manchester. Tom Dunn, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Hoare had been wearing the same clothes for a few days and appeared,. putting it neutrally, not to have the physique and healthy appearance. that one might associate with a professional rugby player. 'That, combined with the general attitude, made the hotel manager not quite believe him.' Hoare had boasted to the hotel owner how he was a rugby player on transfer from Cardiff Blues to London Wasps during his six-night stay at the four-star hotel in Ashford, Kent, which charges up to £445 a night. The court heard on April 13 Hoare stole a man’s phone and used his identity to take out a £150 payday loan. Three. days later, he tricked a woman on Facebook into taking out a £250. payday loan by pretending he ran a mystery shopper scheme. Hoare was spared an immediate prison sentence by a judge at Canterbury Crown Court after he admitted false representation, theft, criminal damage and harassment. He tricked another man using a similar scheme on May 3 - this time through the classified advertising site Gumtree. After. Hoare split with partner Leanne Cooke in September he stole her laptop,. smashed her money jar, slashed her bras and tops in two and sent her. text messages threatening: “I promise I will make headlines with my. antics.” Hoare then used her details to stay four nights at Manchester's Chancellors Hotel before turning up at Eastwell Manor. Handing Hoare a suspended jail sentence, Judge James O’Mahony told him: 'You have behaved as a complete conman. 'You used your quantities of intelligence and ingenuity, using all the modern media and aspects of contemporary life, to rip off other people. 'You clearly have a serious problem with gambling that means you were driven to commit offences. 'If you had only used the intelligence and ingenuity you obviously have, things might have improved.' He added: 'If you don’t do what you are told, back here you come.' Hoare,. of no fixed address, admitted five charges of false representation, two. of theft, one of criminal damage and one of harassment.

"(CNN) -- ""Let me be clear: I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me,"" Apple CEO Timothy D. Cook wrote in an essay published early Thursday by Bloomberg Businessweek. Within hours, the announcement was headlining newspapers all over the world (""Fier d'<unk> atre gay,"" proclaimed Le Figaro) and trending on Twitter. Cook's news caps a year of achievements for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community and its supporters: Gay marriage is now legal in 32 states and the District of Columbia; the NFL drafted its first openly gay player; and a trans woman graced the cover of New York magazine as the nation's highest-paid female executive. Even the Pope praised committed gay relationships. Yet workplace discrimination and its ripple effects remain daunting hurdles for many LGBT individuals. Despite advances in workplace acceptance, over half (53%) of LGBT workers remain closeted at the office, according to a 2014 Human Rights Campaign survey. While many companies excel at publicizing pro-LGBT policies and positions externally, there's an ongoing need for company leaders to promote and act on them internally. After all, the enduring key to the success of LGBT employees is organizations' underlying cultures. Research from the Center for Talent Innovation shows that allies -- people who support LGBT colleagues or work as advocates -- play a decisive role in creating an inclusive community where individuals are comfortable being themselves. CTI data finds that LGBT employees are 1.2 times more likely to be out at companies where straight senior executives express their support publicly (that's 47% versus 21%). In fact, 24% of LGBT workers surveyed attribute their decision to come out professionally to a strong network of allies. Although the ally phenomenon is widespread and growing -- 70% of men and 83% of women consider themselves allies, according to the CTI survey-- far fewer people qualify as ""active allies,"" willing to openly support LGBT colleagues in the workplace. Employers have numerous opportunities to help strengthen ""the ally effect"" by creating networks that invite straight colleagues to support their LGBT co-workers, by sponsoring LGBT individuals and groups, participating in company events, or simply displaying some sort of ally identification in their workspace. Openly gay senior executives being visibly out at work makes a difference as well. LGBT employees are 85% more likely to be out at companies where senior executives are out (24% versus 13%). Being able to be out has measurable benefits. Earlier CTI research found that out LGBTs are more satisfied with their rate of career advancement and more engaged at work; conversely, closeted employees are 73% more likely to say they plan to leave their companies within three years. LGBT employees aren't the only beneficiaries of an inclusive workplace. Employers benefit, too. With LGBT buying power comprising $830 billion in the U.S. alone, companies bolster their bottom line by building and sustaining connections to this large and expanding market. Inclusive companies find that publicizing their support of LGBT equality boosts their standing among consumers across the board: 71% of LGBT adults said they are likely to remain loyal to a brand they believe to be very friendly to the LGBT community even when less-friendly companies may offer lower prices or be more convenient. Further, three-quarters of heterosexuals and 87% of LGBTs said they would consider choosing a brand known to provide equal workplace benefits. LGBT employees are crucial to reaching this market, as CTI's recent research on Innovation, Diversity, and Market Growth reveals. Companies that employ and leverage diverse talent, including employees with LGBT smarts and an understanding of the LGBT global market, better understand their end-users and produce novel solutions for diverse consumer -- if there are allies on the team who make that representative feel secure about raising ideas and sharing insights. The ultimate dividend: the combination of a diverse workforce and leaders who get</s>","Sylvia Hewlett: Tim Cook announced he's gay, capping year of LGBT achievements.

"Plans by Labour to charge visitors from the US and 55 other countries who don't require a visa to enter the UK have been met with dismay by airlines. Under the proposals, nationals in countries enjoying a 'visa waiver' system of fast-track permission to enter the UK will be hit with a charge of around £10 per visit, which the party said would more than cover the £45 million cost of 1,000 extra border guards. That is a similar sum as the US charges for its equivalent service and Labour said tourism experts did not anticipate it would have any impact on the numbers choosing to travel to Britain. Under Labour's plans, passengers who don't require a visa to enter the UK could be met with a £10 entry fee (File Photo) But Nathan Stower, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association (BATA), voiced serious concerns over the proposals. 'While we welcome the desire to improve the customer experience for passengers arriving at the UK border, airlines have significant concerns about this proposal,' he said. 'Visitors from countries like the USA and Australia already pay the highest air passenger tax in the world to fly to the UK – £71 from next April – contributing billions of pounds to the Treasury. Adding yet another charge will make the UK more uncompetitive in attracting tourists, businesses and inbound investment. 'It is not clear how this proposed charge would be collected.

"By. Emma Innes. PUBLISHED:. 09:04 EST, 12 March 2014. |. UPDATED:. 10:16 EST, 12 March 2014. There has long been heated debate about how often bed linen should be changed. But new research suggests millions of Britons are risking illness because they do not replace their pillows and duvet as often as they should. The study revealed that the average person uses their pillows for a year longer than is recommended and that they use the same duvet for two years longer than they should. Some 82 per cent of Britons don't know that pillows should be replaced every two years and duvets, every five. The poll of nearly 2,200 men and women over the age of 18 found that 82 per cent of people do not know how often they should replace their pillows and duvet. According to the Sleep Council, pillows should be replaced every two years and duvets should be thrown away after five years. But, a study by Ergoflex UK showed that the average Briton uses a pillow for 3.2 years and a duvet for 7.6 years. As a result, experts say they are risking neck problems caused by sleeping without enough head and neck support. They are also at risk of health problems associated with dust mite infestations. The survey revealed 57 per cent of people only replace their bedding when it feels like it is wearing thin. Some 46 per cent say they replace it when they feel like it has been too long since they last changed their bedding. By not replacing their pillows, people are putting themselves at risk of sleeping with insufficient neck and head support. Others said they throw out their bedding when they start to struggle to sleep or to get comfortable. For 21 per cent of people it is all about cost – they only buy new bedding when there is a sale on. While people are clueless about how often they should change their bedding, most are aware that pillows should be changed more often than duvets. According to the survey, 61 per cent of people replace their pillows more frequently because they are aware of the hygiene issues associated with not doing so. Jed MacEwan, Managing Director of www.Ergoflex.co.uk, said: ‘We can’t quite believe that 82 per cent of Britons don’t know the recommended time periods which dictate when you should replace your bedding, not to mention that the average Briton uses their pillows and duvet for between one and two years longer than they should. ‘Not only are they increasing their chances of having restless nights, they’re also risking sustained periods of sleeping without an adequate level of support to the neck and head, along with various hygiene problems that may arise from dust mite infestations in older bedding. ‘Independent specialists at the Sleep Council recommend that your mattress should be replaced every seven years, and it’s certainly prudent that duvets and pillows are replaced every five and two years respectively. ‘Of course this is dependent on the quality of the products you buy, and it’s possible to extend the life of your bedding by purchasing protectors. ‘We hope that Britons will look at the results of this study and think long and hard about the various risks they’re posing on themselves by hanging onto their bedding longer than they should – after all it’s a decision that will result in altogether healthier, better quality sleep.’</s> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad>",Pillows should be changed every two years and duvets every five. 82% of people do not know this and most keep their bedding for longer.

"With the word ‘lunacy’ tracing its roots to ‘lunar’, it’s been a common myth for centuries that a full moon causes higher levels of psychological problems and can result in a rise in crime or injuries. But the lunar cycle has no effect on our mental state - and full moon madness can be put down as legend, according to a patient study by psychologists at Université Laval in Québec City, Canada. They analysed 771 patients admitted to emergency wards over three years, in particular those with psychological problems, and found they were no more likely to come in during a full or new moon. Full moon: The lunar cycle has no effect on our mental state, according to a hospital study by psychologists. But medical staff said otherwise, with 80 per cent of nurses and 63 per cent of doctors convinced they saw more patients with mental health problems during a full moon than at any other time. Researchers evaluated patients who visited emergency rooms at Sacré-Coeur Hospital in Montreal, Quebec and Hôtel-Dieu de Lévis in Lévis, Quebec, and linked their visits to lunar calendars. The scientists looked at patients who came in with mystery chest pains - and found a large number of those people suffered from panic attacks, anxiety and mood disorders, or suicidal thoughts. Results showed there was no link between incidence of psychological problems and the four lunar phases, but anxiety disorders were 32 per cent less frequent during the last lunar quarter. Institution: The research was produced by psychologists at Université Laval in Québec City, Canada. Professor Geneviève Belleville from the university’s psychology school said: ‘This may be coincidental or due to factors we did not take into account. But one thing is certain.

"Gary Neville believes the jury is still out on Louis van Gaal's Manchester United as they have yet to play any of the Premier League's leading lights. United sit fourth in the table after an inconsistent start of three wins, two draws and two losses, but will be heartened by their last result - a 2-1 win over Everton at Old Trafford. And while Neville, who spent 19 years as a player at United, believes the future is bright for his old side, he feels the coming month will prove how good Van Gaal's fledgling side is compared with their rivals. The next month will show the true measure of Louis van Gaal's new-look United side, says Gary Neville. 'I think it's an exciting time,' Neville told United's official website. 'It's going to be an important few weeks but exciting as well. We'll find out in the next few weeks as the West Brom, Chelsea and City games are all massive ones that I'm going to be at and my thought is we'll find out exactly [the level] where the team is at this season.' United face a trip to West Brom in their first match after the international break before hosting runaway league leaders Chelsea. United have had some inconsistent results so far this season including a 5-3 hammering at Leicester City. Juan Mata (left) vies for possession with Leighton Baines during United's encouraging 2-1 win over Everton. West Brom AWAY - Monday October 20. Chelsea HOME - Sunday October 26. Man City AWAY - Sunday November 2. Crystal Palace HOME - Saturday November 8. And former Old Trafford stalwart Neville believes Van Gaal will find out the mettle of his side against teams of that calibre rather than the outfits they have faced so far.

They have told the factory's parent company, Bosal, that if they want the building to be handed back over intact, they must agree a better deal for the workers. The workers have threatened to burn down the factory unless their demands are met by company bosses.

"A 16-year-old girl is fighting for her life in hospital after being sexually assaulted, beaten and thrown into a frigid river in Canada, police have said. Rinelle Harper, a student at Southeast College in Winnipeg, was reportedly attacked as she walked along Assiniboine River, near the city's Midtown Bridge, last Friday night. She was allegedly subjected to a'serious sexual assault' - the exact details of which remain unknown - before being hurled into the cold water and left for dead. Scene: Miss Harper was reportedly attacked as she walked along the river (pictured), near the city's Midtown Bridge, last Friday night.She was found lying unconscious on the ground at 7am on Saturday by a passerby. She was found only at 7am the next day by a passerby, who discovered her lying unconscious beside the river, just east of the bridge. It is unknown how the teenager got out of the water. Paramedics were called to the scene and Miss Harper was taken to hospital, according to CTV Winnipeg. She remains in a critical, but stable, condition. Her attacker remains at large. On Monday, Miss Harper's aunt, Holly, told the news station the entire family was shocked by the 'brutal' assault on her niece, who is from the Lake Narrows community. 'I can't even imagine what would provoke such an attack, such as brutal attack on my niece. Who in their right mind would do something so horrible?' she said. She added that doctors had initially thought Miss Harper was going to die, while the police's homicide unit were instructed to start investigating the incident. Shocked: On Monday, police took the rare move of releasing Miss Harper's name, with the consent of her family. Above, Supt Danny Smyth told a press conference he was 'appalled by the viciousness of the attack' However, the teenager - who is originally from Garden Hill, a remote First Nations community in northern Manitoba - is battling through and it is now believed she will survive, she said. 'She has a lot of support around her, a lot of love and support and people praying for her,' Ms Harper told CBC News. 'We want whoever is responsible to be held accountable for this.' On Monday, police took the rare move of releasing Miss Harper's name - with the consent of her family - in the hope that the violent nature of the attack would'resonate' with the public. Killed: It comes just three months after the body of another aboriginal girl - Tina Fontaine (pictured), 15 - was found wrapped in a bag in Manitoba's Red River. 'As a member of the community myself, I'm appalled by the viciousness of this attack,' Winnipeg Police Superintendent Danny Smyth said in a press conference. 'It's important that people are aware that this is an unacceptable attack on our youth and we're hopeful that this will resonate with the community and that people will come forward and help us.' Under Canadian law, survivors of sexual attacks - as well as minors who commit or are the victims of crimes - are typically not identified. It comes just three months after the body of another aboriginal girl - Tina Fontaine, 15 - was found wrapped in a bag in Manitoba's Red River. Both cases are being investigated separately. Miss Harper, whose high school caters for aboriginal students and is owned and operated by nine northern Manitoba First Nations, was allegedly attacked after she got separated from her friends. At the time, she was wearing black leggings, white runners, a dark-coloured North Face hooded jacket and a black 'WUTANG' hoodie,</s>","Rinelle Harper, 16, attacked near Winnipeg's Assiniboine River on Friday. She was'sexually assaulted, beaten, thrown into water and left for dead' Found beside river at 7am next day by a passerby; attacker still at large.

The White-throated Kingfisher munches on the snake as it sits atop a tree at the Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, Rajasthan. The White-throated Kingfisher is widely distributed throughout the Indian sub-continent and can be spotted away from water bodies where it feeds on small amphibians, rodents, birds and even reptiles such as snakes. Delicious: This White-Throated kingfisher can be seen feasting on a snake at a national park in India. The bird is also found in habitats, mostly open country in the plains, and sometimes in the Himalayas, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.

Giant Munster lock Paul O'Connell is leading the 2009 Lions in South Africa. The Lions are comprised of the best players from the four home unions of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland and competition for places in the squad is fierce as club and country loyalties are put aside. In the modern professional era, Lions tours take place every four years, visiting the southern-hemisphere Tri-Nations powers of New Zealand, South Africa and Australia in rotation. A typical tour will see a series of matches against provincial or regional sides, interspersed with international or Test matches. Midweek fixtures are normally against weaker teams, with the Lions giving all their squad members a chance to play, with stronger opposition for the weekend matches which would include the Tests. The 2009 Lions are touring world champions South Africa, looking to improve on the dismal performance of the 2005 side, which visited New Zealand. Under England's 2003 World Cup winning coach Clive Woodward, the 2005 squad were expected to prosper, but slipped to defeat in all three Test matches against the All Blacks. The team was captained by Brian O'Driscoll, but his tour ended after just two minutes of the first Test when he was controversially'spear' tackled by Tana Umaga and Keven Mealamu and dislocated his shoulder. O'Driscoll, who led Ireland to the Six Nations Grand Slam this year, was expected to captain the Lions to South Africa, but coach Ian McGeechan gave the job to Munster lock Paul O'Connell. McGeechan has already gone into Lions history, playing on the 1974 and 1977 tours, and coaching winning teams to Australia and South Africa in 1989 and 1997. He also took them to New Zealand in 1993 where the Test series was lost 2-1. The Lions enjoyed their most successful period in the early 1970s with the 1971 team -- inspired by the Welsh half-back pairing of Gareth Edwards and Barry John -- triumphing against the All Blacks in New Zealand. The 1974 Lions were arguably the best-known and most successful of all time, winning three Tests and drawing one in South Africa and going through the tour unbeaten. Under Irish captain Willie John McBride, their uncompromising forward play set up the victories, with their now infamous catch phrase ""get your retaliation in first"" leading to brutal early exchanges in most games.

"PUBLISHED:. 20:50 EST, 19 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:08 EST, 20 November 2013. JPMorgan Chase & Co has tentatively agreed to pay $13 billion to settle allegations surrounding the quality of mortgage-backed securities it sold in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. If the agreement is finalized it would be the government's highest-profile enforcement action related to the financial meltdown that plunged the economy into the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. A source familiar with negotiations between the bank and federal government said Attorney General Eric Holder, Associate Attorney General Tony West, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and the bank's general counsel, Stephen Cutler, negotiated the tentative settlement in a Friday night phone call. Scroll down for video. Deal: JP Morgan Chase has tentatively agreed to $13bn agreement over mortgage-backed securities. The source, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not been finalized, said the tentative agreement does not resolve a criminal investigation of the bank's conduct. It is being handled by federal prosecutors in Sacramento, California. On Friday night, Mr Holder told the bank that a non-prosecution agreement was a non-starter, meaning that the Justice Department will continue to conduct the criminal investigation of the financial institution. As part of the deal, the Justice Department expects JP Morgan to cooperate with the continuing criminal inquiry into the bank's issuance of mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007, the source said. JP Morgan spokesman Brian Marchiony and Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon declined to comment. Of the $13 billion, fines and penalties will use up $9 billion and $4 billion will go to consumer relief for struggling homeowners, the source claimed. Inquiry: Bank CEO Jamie Dimon testifies before the House financial services hearing in June 2012. Conference call: Attorney General Eric Holder is said to have negotiated the deal in a Friday night phone call. When the housing bubble burst in 2007, bundles of mortgages sold as securities soured and the investors who bought them lost billions. In the aftermath, public outrage boiled over that no high-level Wall Street executives had been sent to jail. Some lawmakers and other critics demanded that the big bailed-out banks and senior executives be held accountable. Negotiations: Security and Exchange Commission head Stephen Cutler is also said to have been involved in the $13 bn deal. In response, the government in January 2012 set up a task force of federal and state law enforcement officials to pursue wrongdoing with regard to mortgage securities. In September, JP Morgan agreed to pay $920 million and admit that it failed to oversee trading that led to a $6 billion loss last year in its London operation. That combined amount, in settlements with three U.S. and one British regulator, is one of the largest fines ever levied against a financial institution. In another case, the company agreed to pay a $100 million penalty and admitted that its traders acted'recklessly' with the London trades. In August, the Justice Department accused Bank of America Corp, the second-largest U.S. bank, of civil fraud in failing to disclose risks and misleading investors in its sale of $850 million in mortgage bonds in 2008. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a related lawsuit. The government estimates that investors lost more than $100 million on the deal. Bank of America disputes the allegations. The latest action against JP Morgan brought the weight of the Obama administration against the bank, which has enjoyed a reputation for managing risk better than its Wall Street competitors. JP Morgan came through the financial crisis in better shape than most of its rivals and Mr Dimon, its chief executive, charmed lawmakers and commanded the attention of regulators in Washington.

"By. Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 12:29 EST, 26 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 13:53 EST, 26 November 2013. On June 4, an unsupported four-story wall crashed down onto a Philadelphia Salvation army, trapping workers and shoppers for 13 hours and killing six people. Despite an architect's warnings that the wall might collapse the night before, demolition contractor Griffin T. Campbell decided not to brace the wall in order to cut costs. He ended up cutting limbs. Mariya Plekan was one of those victims, and remembers being trapped in the store for 13 hours. She took the bus to Center City in Philadelphia hoping to find shopping deals, but found disaster instead. Her story was made public for the first time yesterday by her lawyers who are helping her to sue responsible parties. Mariya Plekan, who lost her legs after being pulled from the Salvation Army rubble, told her story for the first time yesterday. Now the twice Widowed Ukrainian woman will be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life after losing her legs to amputation after her bloodied body was pulled from the rubble by a rescue team. 'They started to move things around, then I had a hope, I had a hope that they will save me shortly. But it didn't happen,' she said. 'I was screaming, 'Help, help.' But nobody heard me. And I remember everything.' Philly.com reports that Common Pleas Judge Mark Bernstein put a stop on civil cases so that the criminal investigation could unfold, but he made an exception for Plekan due to her serious medical condition. She was caught beneath the rubble for 13 hours before a rescue dog heard her cries for help. Her Lawyer Andy Stern of the Kline & Specter firm was there with her on Wednesday night as she spoke through a translator. Stern said her medical bills are already millions of dollars and will continue to rise. 'I was looking through the clothes and all of a sudden I heard the noise,' said Plekan, 52. 'And the only thing that I had a chance to say is, 'Why?' and the roof collapsed.... And my limbs, my legs were pinned down,' she continued. Plekan said she was stuck under the rubble but that she could see a tiny light and was able to hear distant voices of the rescue team above her. She cried for help but no one heard her at first. Finally, a search dog heard her cries and led a firefighter towards her. 'The. dog followed my yell...And they started pulling things apart and they. pulled me out. And I didn't realize that it was night because the. spotlights were on. I was so happy that I was saved,' she said. The collapse could have been prevented if the 40 foot free standing wall had been secured the night before. She was a healthy mother of two and grandmother before she was brutally injured during the building collapse. 'My children and my granddaughter - because of them, I want to live, I want to live,' she said. 'But it's so hard. 'Pain, pain, pain, and that pain is still going on... the pain of my flesh, but as well of my soul,' she lamented. 'I have a normal memory and I have a normal understanding of how I am living right now. And every day I understand how hard it is to be without legs. When you cannot take care of yourself when you constantly depend on other people to take care of you, and I do not know how to live after that because it's so hard</s>","Mariya Plekan told her story for the first time yesterday in an effort to help sue those responsible for the collapse. She lost both her legs after being pulled from the rubble after a rescue dog heard her cries. Contractor Griffin T. Campbell who was responsible for the collapse was charged with with murder, manslaughter and reckless endangerment after choosing 'greed' over safety.</s> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad>",<pad> By.

But a GIF has revealed the fiery process that takes place when the manned Soyuz spacecraft first comes into contact with the thick atmosphere - before it makes its daring descent back to Earth. Scroll down for video. This GIF shows the moment cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky, and astronaut Michael Hopkins, returned to Earth in March this year at the culmination of ISS Expedition 38. Up to three crew members can return to Earth at any one time in one of the Soyuz TMA spacecraft. This is why the ISS has a crew of six. Three people are taken there and back every six months, with crews of three overlapping with each other so that the same crew doesn’t all depart at the same time. The GIF shows the moment the ablative heat shield of the Soyuz begins to bear the brunt of the temperatures of re-entry. On 23 November 2014 a Russian rocket blasted off to deliver three new crew members to the International Space Station - including Italy's first female astronaut. Soyuz TMA-15M, holding incoming station commander Terry Virts, with the US space agency Nasa, left the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazahkstan. Also on board for the lift-off at 3am local time (Sunday 9pm GMT) was Soyuz commander Anton Shkaplerov, with the Russian Federal Space Agency. Ablative means that it ‘burns up’ on re-entry to dissipate heat away from the cabin and keep the astronauts safe. But aside from a small amount of manouevring, there is not much for the astronauts to do during re-entry - except to sit and hope. 'There's not much an astronaut can do as their module re-enters Earth atmosphere but strap in, hold on tight and put their faith in years of proven science and technology,' Ben Biggs, Editor of All About Space Magazine, told MailOnline. 'That can hardly be much consolation though: the temperature on the outside of their high speed spacecraft can be hot enough to melt iron due to friction with the Earth's atmosphere, while the effect of deceleration can be greater than seven times Earth gravity. 'Humans are better able to withstand g-forces perpendicular to the spine, which is why these astronauts are on their backs for re-entry.' The Soyuz (shown) is actually composed of three elements end-to-end - the Orbital Module (top left), the Descent Module (middle) and the Instrumentation/Propulsion Module (bottom right) As it makes its way through the atmosphere (shown), the capsule is subjected to intense temperature, which burn away the ablative heat shield on board - as it is designed to do. Ablative means that it ‘burns up’ on re-entry to dissipate heat away from the cabin and keep the astronauts safe. Expedition 38 returned to Earth on 11 March 2014 (shown) in the snowy reaches of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan after a six-month stay aboard the ISS. Here the three-man crew of the mission are seen on the ground after exiting from the Descent Module. Their journey back to Earth lasted about 3.5 hours in total.

"A female IRA bomber who implicated Gerry Adams in the murder of suspected 'traitor' Jean McConnell has been found dead at her home. Mother-of-two Dolours Price, one of the militants who bombed the Old Bailey in 1973, died of a suspected drug overdose in Malahide, north Dublin. The 62-year-old had in recent years been an outspoken critic of the Sinn Fein President, who has always denied ever being a member of the IRA. Found dead: IRA Old Bailey bomber Dolours Price, pictured in 2010, was found dead in her home in Malahide in north Dublin on Wednesday night. Jailed: Price, pictured left in 1989, was sentenced to life in prison for her role in the bomb attack on the Old Bailey courthouse in 1973. But the mother-of-two was freed after eight years. Carnage: The scene after an IRA bomb exploded outside the Old Bailey in central London in 1973 which killed one person and injured 200 people. Allegations:. Price - an outspoken critic of the peace process - accused Sinn Fein. President Gerry Adams, who has always denied ever having been a member. of the IRA, of sanctioning the Old Bailey court attack. She accused Mr Adams of personally. ordering the abduction of several of the 'disappeared' - people the IRA believed to be. traitors in the 1970s. They included Belfast mother-of-10 Mrs McConville, a Catholic who comforted a British soldier. Dead: An allegation was made that Jean McConville was killed by the 'unknowns' squad. Mrs McConville, a 37-year-old widow, was shot in the head in 1972. Price alleged that she was given the task of driving Mrs McConville away from her 10 children in the Divis flats complex to her death. on the Co Louth coast. Her body was found more than three decades later on a beach in County Louth. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph last year, Price said: 'I. never knew for sure their ultimate end. 'I was simply told by Gerry Adams to take the people away, a couple of. lads or whatever. Some I knew their fate, some I didn't.' Price was found by family members at her home on Wednesday night. A garda spokesman said her death is not being treated as suspicious. She also accused Mr Adams of sanctioning the Old Bailey court attack, in which one man died and more than 200 people were injured - 33 of whom were in Whitehall. Price - the former wife of Hollywood actor Stephen Rea - was part of the IRA unit that planted four car bombs outside the Old Bailey, as was her sister Marian. Two of the bombs exploded. The sisters and their gang were arrested as they tried to get back into Ireland. Price was. sentenced to life for the bombing but freed eight years later in 1981 because she was suffering from an eating disorder. History: Price had two sons with her ex-husband Hollywood actor Stephen Rea, pictured, who was one of the voices dubbed over that of Mr Adams during the 1980s broadcasting ban on him.

"(CNN) -- Venezuela's president says right-wing opponents have unleashed a new weapon in their push to destabilize his government and demoralize his supporters: an imitation of Hugo Chavez's voice. An audio recording widely circulated on social media purports to be the late Venezuelan leader saying he's still alive. The recording comes nearly seven months after authorities announced Chavez's death from cancer and just a few months before municipal elections in the politically polarized South American country. President Nicolas Maduro said Saturday that the recording implying that Chavez has been kidnapped is fake, and he isn't taking it lightly. ""These people have no ethical limit, they have no moral limit, they have no scruples,"" Maduro said in televised remarks at a United Socialist Party of Venezuela event. The recording purports to be a message from Chavez to his brother. A voice that sounds like Chavez says he is recovering, that his death was a lie and that he is ""more alive than ever."" J.J.

"The run-up to the Super Bowl on Sunday has been marred by deflate-gate - and it's hurting Tom Brady's feelings. The New England Patriots quarterback says he took football tampering allegations personally after 11 of the 12 footballs tested by the NFL were found to be two PSI less than league minimums. Brady once again denied having anything to do with the fact that they were improperly inflated in an interview with WEEI sports radio in Boston on Monday. Scroll down for audio. New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady says reports he was involved in deflate-gate 'hurt his feelings' Brady appeared on Monday alongside owner Bob Kraft (second right) and head coach Bill Belichick (right) 'I’ve tried to wrap my head around it, too. I’ve done that and I’m trying to move past that, because I continue to try to rehash things,' he said. 'I personalized a lot of things and thought this was all about me, and my feelings got hurt. 'Then I moved past it, because it’s not serving me.' The Patriots are still fending off cheating allegations less than a week before the Super Bowl, where they will face the Seattle Seahawks this coming Sunday. Adoring fans braved the cold - and threat of blizzard - to send their team off to Phoenix on Monday. Critics have suggested that billionaire team owner Kraft (left) could get the team out of trouble. Already, some Seahawks are speaking out about the NFL's investigation of 'deflate-gate.' Richard Sherman, the Seattle cornerback, says he doesn't believe the Patriots will be punished for breaking the rules because Patriots owner Robert Kraft is so close to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. 'Will they be punished? Probably not. Not as long Robert Kraft and Roger Goodell are still taking pictures at their respective homes. He was just at Kraft's house last week before the AFC Championship. Talk about conflict of interest. As long as that happens, it won't affect them at all,' Sherman fumed. Brady told WEEI that he has now blocked out the deflate-gate speculation and is working to focus 100 percent on the upcoming Super Bowl - his sixth appearance with the Patriots. On Sunday, he told ESPN that he hadn't been contacted by NFL investigators - and didn't expect to hear from them until after the big game. Investigators found that 11 out of the 12 footballs used by the Patriots offense during the AFC Championship game were under-inflated, which makes them easier to throw, catch and carry. The Indianapolis Colts complained that the Patriots' footballs were under-inflated during their 45-7 drubbing in the AFC Championship game on January 18.

"A British oil executive shot dead outside a restaurant was the victim of a 'nervous criminal who experienced a violent rage', detectives believe. Nicolas Mockford, 59, died instantly after being shot four times in Brussels. Police are working on the ehteory that he was the victim of a failed robbery rather than being targeted by hitmen. Mr Mockford's wife Mary was beaten badly around the face as she tried to stop two men taking her handbag and the keys to the couple's £40,000 Lexus 4x4 car. Nicholas Mockford, pictured centre, was cradled by his wife as he lay dying after he was shot three times as he walked to his Lexus SUV. Mr Mockford, pictured here inside a boat, was reportedly the head of marketing for interim technologies for ExxonMobil Chemicals, Europe, promoting new types of greener fuel. A family member said that Mr Mockford, a. long-serving department head at ExxonMobil, had been assassinated, but. could not explain why he was a target. The relation told the Daily Telegraph: 'We are all confused about what has happened. Nick was a genuinely lovely, clean-cut, mild-mannered family man.' He added: 'He was shot so calmly and so quickly, it smacks horribly of a professional hit, but we can't fathom why. He isn't the type to cave in to blackmail and it just doesn't compute.' Details of the killing, which took place in the Belgian capital at about 10pm on October 14, were until now shrouded in secrecy because. police imposed a news blackout. The theory he was the victim of a professional hit, possibly by Eastern European gunmen, is being examined because ExxonMobil have refused to release details about his work in 'intermediate technologies'. Police have not ruled out a robbery that went wrong and that Mr Mockford died trying to protect his wife from a violent mugging. But relatives believe he may have been executed because neither his silver Lexus 4x4 nor his wife Mary's handbag were taken. Shocking: Belgian women look on as a street cleaner washes away bloodstains from the spot where the oil worker was shot. A source close to the investigation. said: ‘We are looking into his work dealings to see if he had any enemies or was working on anything sensitive. ‘Officers. searched his house straight after his murder while his wife was in. hospital to see if there were any clues which may identify a motive for. the attack.’ Detectives believe Mr Mockford was killed by a 'nervous criminal' who experienced a 'violent rage' before firing four bullets in quick succession. A senior investigator said: 'A nervous criminal is likely to have got into a violent rage as the couple effectively fought back,' quoting expert police profilers. 'Four bullets entered the victim's body in quick succession. The victim's wife was also beaten severely round the face - also suggesting sudden and severe anger.' The profilers have spent almost two weeks studying the circumstances of the murder. A witness who saw Mrs Mockford after. the attack said: ‘She was clearly shocked. She said the men were. demanding money and the car.’ However, the ferocity of the attack and the fact that Mr Mockford received a ‘coup de grace’ shot to the upper body as he was bleeding on the floor have prompted detectives to consider other options. The family home of Nicholas Mockford,</s>","Nicholas Mockford, 60, was shot dead on October 14 but Belgian police imposed a news blackout.

"Blastoff for the spacecraft which could one day take humans to Mars is set for the final countdown as Nasa revealed the capsule has been completed. It will blast the experimental capsule in orbit using a huge Delta IV Heavy Rocket already waiting on the launchpad - although the rockets are then expected to be replaced by Nasa's even bigger Space Launch system. The assembled Orion crew module, service module, launch abort system and adapter will reside in Kennedy's Launch Abort System Facility until its scheduled rollout to the launch pad, set for Nov. 10. Scroll down for video. NASA's Orion spacecraft was completed Thursday, Oct. 30, 2014 in the Launch Abort System Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It will reside there until Nov. 10, when it will be rolled out to Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ahead of its Dec. 4 test flight. The three common booster cores are 134 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter. Each has an RS-68 engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant producing 656,000 pounds of thrust. All totaled, the three Delta IV boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust. The second stage of the Delta IV rocket is 45 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter. It uses one RL10-B-2 engine, also burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant creating 25,000 pounds of thrust. At the launch pad, it will be lifted onto the United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket that will carry it into space for its uncrewed flight test. 'This is just the first of what will be a long line of exploration missions beyond low earth orbit, and in a few years we will be sending our astronauts to destinations humans have never experienced,' said Bill Hill, deputy associate administrator for Exploration Systems Development. 'It's thrilling to be a part of the journey now, at the beginning.' 'We've been working toward this launch for months, and we're in the final stretch,' said Kennedy Director Bob Cabana. Last month the Delta IV Heavy rocket, built by United Launch Alliance, made its move to nearby Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The rocket's three Common Booster Cores were tested, processed and attached to each other to form the first stage that will connect to Orion's service module. It then was raised Wednesday from the horizontal position into its vertical launch configuration. 'Orion is almost complete and the rocket that will send it into space is on the launch pad. 'We're 64 days away from taking the next step in deep space exploration.' Orion was moved Sunday out of the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida as its launch abort system was fitted. This system is designed to protect astronauts if a problem arises during launch by pulling the spacecraft away from the failing rocket. During the December, uncrewed flight, the jettison motor, which separates the launch abort system from the crew module in both normal operations and emergency, will be tested. For Orion's dry run, the Lockheed Martin Corp.-built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast, and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays. Once the launch abort system is stacked on the completed crew and service modules, and the three systems are tested together, the Orion spacecraft will be considered complete. It then will wait inside the launch abort system facility until mid-November, when the Delta IV Heavy rocket is ready for integration with the spacecraft.

"By. Sam Webb. A pair of biscuits which amazingly survived some of the bloodiest battles of the First World War are to go under the hammer. The bidding at Lockdales auctioneers in Martlesham, near Ipswich, Suffolk, will start at £60, but huge worldwide interest sparked by the 100th anniversary of the start of the Great War make a much higher final figure likely. A soldier, L. B Charles, who fought in the bloody battles of Gallipoli and the Dardanelles in Turkey, brought the biscuits home with him. Tough: These biscuits from a major campaign in the First World War will go under the hammer next week. They are almost 100 years old. Chris Elmy, of Lockdales auctioneers, with the enduring wartime 'treats'. Interest in the First World War is at a peak and is expected to drive up the price. He is thought to be Lt Lionel Bruce Charles of the 5th Battalion, The Queen’s Regiment, said to have lived for a time at Wroxham House, Norwich. The biscuits have been preserved for 99 years and now the bizarre war-time keepsakes are to be sold. Each one has a label on that reads 'Biscuits used by troops in Suvla Bay', the Turkish peninsula captured by British forces after horrific fighting and massive losses. Dr Rachel Duffett of the University of Essex is an expert on food eaten by soldiers during the conflict and is the author of 'The Stomach for Fighting: Food and the Soldiers of The Great War'. British troops returning from the trenches during the Dardanelles campaign. Much of the campaign was a shambles and Allied losses were heavy. She said: 'The reason they last so long is they're pretty much inedible. They're made from flour, salt and water and that's about it. 'They're rock hard.' The three ingredients are mixed into a paste and then baked for about 45 minutes on a high heat - a recipe Dr Duffett has tried. She added: 'They are just dreadful. They're like the worst children's rusk ever.' Could the one up for auction still be edible? Dr Duffett wouldn't advise taking a bite. 'I don't think they would kill you. I wouldn't want to try though.' At the start of the war, British soldiers at the front were allowed 10oz of meat and 8oz of vegetables per day, but this soon fell as supply lines were disrupted due thanks to naval blockades and the chaos of war. By 1916, the meat ration was down to 6oz a day, and as the war wore on, meat was only provided once every nine days. Other goods provided - nearly always tinned - were tea, bacon, cheese, jam and (famously disgusting) meat stews. Soldiers were forced to fend for themselves and reportedly grew vegetable patches in reserve trenches and hunted and fished in quiet moments. Cooks tried to find local vegetables when possible, but were often forced to use weeds, nettles and leaves to add to stews and soups. Flour was scarce in 1916 and ground-up turnips were used as a substitute, resulting in bread that gave soldiers severe stomach problems. Tommies were also forced to endure pea-soup with horse meat chunks. By the time troops began to land at Suvla Bay the Turks were well dug in - and exacted a terrible price. The biscuits are famous for the hardness and longevity that has seen many survive for nearly a century. Indeed, some were</s>","The notoriously tough biscuits have endured more than nine decades. They were brought home from bloody WW1 campaign in Turkey. The biscuits were so hardy some soldiers turned them into picture frames.

"SAVANNAH, Georgia (CNN) -- What does it really take to dress someone as fashion-forward and in the spotlight as Michelle Obama? Designer Yigal Azrou<unk> l talks with students at the Savannah College of Art and Design. ""Bravery,"" says Isabel Toledo, designer of the first lady's attention-grabbing lemongrass yellow wool and lace ensemble that she wore for the inauguration of her husband President Obama. But along with bravery about their fashion sense, new graduates at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) will need courage in the face of the current recession. ""Fashion is being hit particularly hard in the new job market. Fashion as a whole is feeling a greater level of lost revenues and in turn has lost opportunities for sustaining volume and even more so for growth,"" said Marshal Cohen, chief analyst and expert fashion analyst for the NPD market research group. ""The ironic thing is that new ideas and creations are just what the industry needs but is too cautious to react to it,"" he added. Full of new ideas, student designers say they are aware of the challenges as they head out into the work force, but they're optimistic they can make it in these tough times. ""After I graduate, I'm going to New York, I have an internship lined up with a trend forecasting company, Promostyl,"" said Shelby Simon whose designs made it into SCAD's annual fashion show. See the runway fashions ». ""Everyone needs an assistant so hopefully I'll be able to find something pretty easily,"" said Caitlin Clarke. She would like to land an internship in New York and has interviewed with New York & Co. and applied for positions at Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein and Zac Posen. Toledo, a world-renown designer, knows it can be tough to make it in fashion. She and her fashion illustrator husband Ruben Toledo didn't have much money when they arrived from Cuba in the late 60s as political refugees. She says she found inspiration in the little things. Experts' advice on getting to top of fashion business ». ""Go out there and look at things, look at things well. Study them; the smallest things can inspire you. That will make you able to do what you want on any level. Many times kids think you have to have all this backing coming into a big industry. I didn't do that, I started from the bottom and as a matter of fact you can only go up,"" said Isabel Toledo. Toledo was at the school last weekend to accept the 2009 André Leon Talley Lifetime Achievement Award. But for six months, two other top designers, Yigal Azrou<unk> l and Lars Nilsson, have been mentoring and critiquing 23 students to help them develop their designs for the runway. Azrou<unk> l, a self-taught designer, says it's a tough industry and students have to pay their dues. ""It's not what people think it is or what it looks like from the outside. If you want to be a fashion designer you have to carry fabric on your back, you need to learn how to cut and sew. The fame is going to come later."" More known for his expert draping techniques, Yigal Azrou<unk> l taught students more than how to incorporate intricate folds and pleats in their designs. ""If you love something, go ahead and do it, but, be very consistent with it,"" advised Azrou<unk> l. SCAD senior Caitlin Clarke says working with Nilsson really helped her create new silhouettes and structured angles with interesting seams. ""Lars was so helpful. I remember this one time when he came in and said 'Ah, there's something not right with this dress' and then he helped me cut it up and fix it,"" said Clarke. Nilsson enjoyed the process.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham has warned of a risk to patient safety after figures revealed a significant rise in the use of private sector ambulances by some trusts. Labour has warned of a risk to patient safety after figures revealed a significant rise in the use of private sector ambulances by some trusts. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said people would be stunned that 'blue-light 999 services' were being privatised without proper debate. He will write to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to ask for an urgent assurance about the safety and quality of all privately-provided emergency ambulance services. Freedom of Information requests. submitted by Labour revealed increases on spending by three English. ambulance services on private contractors in the last two years. The biggest rise in spending was in London which saw a tenfold increase in the amount spent increase from £400,000 in 2010/11 to £4.2million in 2012/13. South East Coast Ambulance service spent £7.3million up from £1.9million in 2010/11 while in Yorkshire the spend on private. contractors went up from £500,000 to £1.8million. Mr Burnham said: 'When people dial. 999, they don't expect a private ambulance to turn up. This news will. open people's eyes to the way the NHS is changing under David Cameron. 'People will be stunned to learn that even blue-light 999 services are being privatised without proper debate. 'It is proof that the Coalition sees. no limits on privatisation in the NHS. They are driving the private. sector into the public core of the NHS, offering up essential emergency. provision to the lowest bidder. 'Whistleblowers have contacted Labour with concerns that even the most serious 999 calls are being handled by private ambulances without properly trained staff and equipment. 'This is cost-cutting privatisation at. its crudest, with a real risk that patient safety will be compromised. Jeremy Hunt must provide urgent assurances about the quality and safety. of these private services.'

"(CNN) -- Inside a dilapidated warehouse, underneath scattered clothes hanging from rusty pipes, a young black man is down on his knees. His feet are naked, his trousers rolled up to his knees as he beats his sodden shirt against the ground to remove the dirt from it. Near him, a cluster of men cut desolate figures -- some of them crouching down to wash their worn-out clothes, some standing, naked, trying to clean up their work-wasted bodies. This is not a scene from prison life -- but it might as well have been. Instead, this is a communal shower room for mineworkers in South Africa under apartheid as captured by pioneering photographer Ernest Cole some five decades ago. A tiny man -- barely five feet tall -- with a great eye for detail, Cole was one of South Africa's first black photojournalists. His captivating and often clandestine images documented different aspects of black life under apartheid, opening a window into the oppression and economic inequality endured by his people during that brutal era, including mineworkers forced to live in squalid conditions. In 1967, one year after leaving South Africa to go into exile, Cole published his first and only photo book, entitled ""House of Bondage."" The book, which was banned in South Africa, quickly sold out and received great critical acclaim. But despite the initial success, Cole died destitute and lonely in New York in 1990 and until recently his story was largely unknown. Yet in recent years, Cole's work has received renewed recognition, with several exhibitions in South Africa and abroad. And now, New York University's Grey Art Gallery is the latest institution to commemorate his ground-breaking work by hosting the first solo touring museum exhibition of 120 rare black-and-white gelatin silver prints from Cole's archive at the Hasselblad Foundation in Gothenburg, Sweden. ""Ernest Cole's life and work were dominated by the apartheid system,"" says Gunilla Knape, curator of the exhibition that runs until December 6. ""It was the theme of his most important photographic work, it was the reason for his going into exile and becoming a stateless, but recognized, stranger in the world,"" she continues. ""The story of Ernest Cole is very little known and this exhibition is an attempt to shed light on his life and work, and to make part of a large collection of his photographs available to a broad international audience, not the least in Cole's native country."" Dangerous mission. The son of a tailor and a laundry woman, Cole was born in Eersterust, a black freehold township near Pretoria, in 1940. The fourth of six children, he grew up living in the countryside with an aunt because his parents wanted to protect him from crime in urban townships. Cole reunited with his parents as a teenager and it was then that his interest in photography began. Aged 15, Cole received his first camera from a family friend, and from then on he would carry it everywhere, always taking pictures of friends, relatives and people in his community. In 1958, Cole started working as a darkroom and layout assistant at Drum Magazine, a radical black lifestyle publication in Johannesburg. He also enrolled in a correspondence photography course from the New York Institute of Photography before leaving Drum in 1960 to work as a chief photographer on a weekly South African newspaper and as a freelancer for the international press. During that period, Cole came across the photo essays of Henri Cartier-Bresson, the celebrated French photographer. Inspired by Cartier-Bresson's style, especially his refusal to crop his images, Cole set out on a dangerous mission to capture the injustice of the apartheid system and communicate it to the people outside South Africa.

"New York (CNN) -- An ""all-clear"" was given at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport Wednesday night after a DHL cargo facility there was evacuated following the discovery of a suspicious package, authorities said. The package originated from Yemen -- the source of last week's thwarted bomb plot -- said New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. The package was an envelope containing a cell phone and paperwork, Browne said. Investigators said they were looking at a ""solid mass"" in the package at JFK that showed up on an X-ray and was inconsistent with what they had been told were documents in the package. The package was addressed to a New York destination, a law enforcement source said. ""The bomb squad was called in to check it out,"" the NYPD's Browne said. ""It was cleared."" The package was discovered at 6:30 p.m. ET Wednesday, an official said. FBI agents, Port Authority police and U.S. Customs and Border Protection had inspected the package ""out of an abundance of caution,"" New York FBI spokesman Rich Kolko said. ""All clear. DHL got their signals crossed,"" John Kelly, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, told CNN. ""All is well and over."" A DHL spokeswoman, Beatrice Garcia, confirmed some information about the suspicious package but rejected the Port Authority's statement about the delivery company getting its signals crossed. Senior law enforcement officials said the package was one of the more than a dozen packages from Yemen that investigators had been looking for since Friday. At least seven other packages from that batch have been cleared by U.S. officials. Earlier Wednesday, the head of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration visited Yemen, five days after authorities disrupted a plot to send bombs from the Middle Eastern nation to the United States, the federal agency announced. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, meanwhile, talked about cargo screening with top representatives of global shipping companies including DHL, FedEx, TNT and UPS, her department said. She talked about ""enhanced screening"" after shipping companies apparently carried the bombs unawares. She pressed home the same message in a call to the head of the International Air Transport Association, Giovanni Bisignani, the department said. TSA Administrator John Pistole met with Yemeni government officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Rashad al-Alimi, representatives from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and the Ministry of Interior, and U.S. ambassador Gerald Feierstein, the TSA said. Pistole also received briefings from TSA inspectors deployed to Yemen and toured a cargo facility in Sanaa, the nation's capital. Yemen said Monday that it is tightening security at all of its airports. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates and Britain found two packages Friday with explosives that were destined for synagogues in Chicago, Illinois. The explosive found in the United Arab Emirates may have traveled on passenger planes to get there, airline officials said Sunday. Investigators in Yemen say they strongly suspect that Ibrahim Hasan al-Asiri, al Qaeda's top bomb maker in the region, is behind the explosive devices sent in the parcels. U.S. authorities are said to be also looking at al-Asiri because the parcel bombs used the same explosive, PETN, as last year's foiled underwear bomber, also linked to him.

"As I sat in Dr. Valentin Fuster's exam room at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, only one word raced through my mind: ""Whoa!"" That was it. I was floored. I really couldn't understand why this was happening to me -- and now. I had beaten obesity and, for the first time in my life, I was hitting the gym regularly and practicing portion control in my diet. I'd taken up tennis and, in fact, was actually pretty decent. This is me we're talking about --someone who'd never run for, hit or even caught a ball until I was 42. Even though I felt and looked great, I was experiencing what I now know are the classic symptoms of heart disease: frequent intense heart palpitations, light-headedness, shortness of breath and extreme fatigue. But I always thought that heart disease was an old white dude's disease. That's what I'd seen on television anyway. It didn't happen to newly skinny black women who had it going on. Or, at least thought they had it going on. I couldn't have been more wrong. I was about to be the face of heart disease. When my doctors told me they were going to crack my chest open and take my heart out of my body to repair my aortic valve and remove a subaortic membrane to stave off future heart issues, it scared the crap out of me! I sincerely considered not having the surgery. But I knew I needed to be strong. So, I got focused. I became determined. And yes, at times, I was terrified. Anyone who goes through cardiac surgery and tells you they weren't scared is lying. We're all human. Fortunately, the skill level of my physicians and the resources that were available to me left me encouraged by the prognosis for recovery. Amazingly, even though the doctors stopped my heart for 22 minutes on the operating table, I made it through open-heart surgery without any complications. As part of my recovery, I elected to do cardiac rehab. That was the second-best decision of my life. Three months of pushing myself to the limit with steadfast determination to recover fully was my goal. The discipline necessary to strengthen your heart after surgery is relentless and exhausting but so worth it. I was lucky. No, more like blessed. I came through heart disease, and today I'm a survivor. With my recovery, I realized I had an obligation that reached beyond my own health. I made a commitment to use whatever platform I have in the public eye to raise awareness of heart disease in women. According to the American Heart Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of all Americans. It's the No. 1 killer of African-Americans, and it's the No. 1 killer of women. So, you see, heart disease for me is personal -- very personal. For three years, I've served as the National Volunteer for the AHA and a volunteer spokeswoman for their Go Red For Women movement. The movement aims to dispel myths surrounding heart disease and raise awareness. It's a passionate, emotional and social initiative designed to empower women to take charge of their heart health. The goal is to harness the energy, passion and power women have to band together and, collectively, wipe out our No. 1 killer. With National Wear Red Day coming up this Friday, I'm reminded that bringing awareness to heart disease isn't about just wearing red one day a year. It's a lifestyle. It's about sharing your story and empowering each other to make heart health a priority starting now. I'm thankful for the voice I have when it comes to fighting this preventable disease. I've made it my mission to do what I know how to do -- talk -- to anyone who'll listen to my story. And, believe me, I'</s>","TV personality Star Jones was diagnosed with heart disease in 2010.

She was airlifted to hospital on November 30 where it was confirmed she had suffered a L1 fracture of the spine - a similar injury she had suffered after falling off Cher in 2011. It is the second time she has suffered serious injuries when she took Cher out for a ride. The 16.2 hand horse, a thorough-bred cross Cleveland Bay, is looked after at the White Horse Equine Centre, near Daventry, Northants. Kristine, who lives with her parents near the equine centre, said: 'We were doing some work without the stirrups and my horse went into canter and I panicked, which made her panic and we ended up doing, quite literally, the wall of death. 'I was pretty badly winded. I lay there for a couple of minutes and tried to get up but I couldn’t. 'We phoned for an ambulance but we were then called back to ask if there was a field for the air ambulance to land in. 'I think most people would rather not be strapped down on a board and flown to hospital. 'Since my first accident I have had to ride slightly differently and I am heavy on my right side so my balance isn’t as good. 'I could feel I was going to fall off and we were going flat out so probably travelling at about 25mph. 'Onlookers said I landed on my head and then flipped over and was then in heap. 'I was conscious so I remember it. I thought I had done my pelvis so I was just really nervous not knowing what injuries I had. I had so much adrenaline I don’t think the pain set in at first. Kristine, pictured riding Cher, had to be airlifted to hospital after the 25mph fall. Kristine, pictured on the day of the accident, said she will get back in the saddle but will not ride Cher again after breaking her back twice in separate falls in two years. 'My hat was in pieces so it really shows how important it is to wear a hat while riding. 'I just remember thinking I have got to get up, this can’t be happening again but my body just wouldn’t move. 'I won’t be riding Cher again which is sad but a friend of mine will be looking after her.' Kristine returned home from hospital on December 2 and now needs to remain flat for 22 hours a day for six weeks to help her fracture recover. She first broke her spine on July 27, 2011 when Cher, who weighs 70 stone, rolled on top of her before standing on her leg.

"A New Jersey high school cheerleader who claims she was ‘abandoned’ by her mother and retired police chief father when they kicked her out for not playing by their rules filed a lawsuit last week demanding they fork over immediate financial support. Rachel Canning has turned 18 but the rare lawsuit aims to force her parents to support her even though she’s living with a friend’s family who are shelling out thousands for her attorney fees. Meanwhile, Sean Canning has shot back saying his college-bound daughter is nothing but a ‘spoiled’ liar who left home on her own when she couldn’t live by the former officer’s rules. Scroll down for video. Sick: Rachel's mother submitted court documents in which she claimed to have supported her daughter throughout her bulimia battle after finding garbage sacks full of vomit hidden in her bedroom. Won't pay: Rachel's retired police chief father Sean Canning denies he and his wife Amy kicked out Rachel and say she left on her own accord because she didn't want to follow his rules. He's fighting back against his daughter's financial demands. While her exact reason for leaving remains foggy, neither side in the Morris County, New Jersey suit is refuting that Rachel left her home in comfortable Lincoln Park sometime on or near her 18th birthday on November 1. Rachel, who’s already received acceptance letters to several universities and a $20,000 scholarship offer from a New York private college, claims she was forced out of her home on her birthday after her father and mother Amy jointly decided to cut her off ‘from all support both financially and emotionally.’ ‘My parents have rationalized their. actions by blaming me for not following their rules,’ court papers filed. on behalf of the teen claim. ‘They stopped paying my high school. tuition to punish the school and me and have redirected my college fund. indicating their refusal to afford me an education as a punishment.’ According. to DailyRecord.com, Sean and Amy Canning owe Morris Catholic $5,306 in. tuition they’ve neglected to pay since the start of the family feud. The father of Rachel's friend, attorney john Inglesino (pictured) says he and his wife are helping her sue her parents because without her parents, 'Rachel's ability to fulfill her potential will be greatly diminished' And it’s not just because of their missing money that school administrators appear to be backing Rachel. 'Rachel. has excellent grades and will not be removed from the school for this. non-payment; however her parents do have a contractual obligation to. pay. Rachel is certainly unable at this time to attend Morris Catholic. High School full-time and support herself financially,' Morris Catholic. president Michael St. Pierre wrote in a certification to the court. St. Pierre said the school called New Jersey Child Protection and. Permanency last fall after abuse allegations from Rachel and what he. called ‘difficult meetings between Rachel and Mr. Canning.’ Mr. Canning admits a state worker visited the home just prior to Rachel’s. alleged ‘abandonment,’ but that the official found the teen simply to be. ‘spoiled’ and didn’t pursue the abuse allegations. 'We. love our child and miss her. This is terrible. It’s killing me and my. wife. We have a child we want home. We’re not draconian and now we’re. getting hauled into court. She’s demanding that we pay her bills but she. doesn’t want to live at home and she’s saying “I don’t want to live. under your rules,”' Mr. Canning said. Mr. Canning contends that his daughter left on her</s>","College-bound honors student Rachel Canning of Lincoln Park, New Jersey says she was 'abandoned' by her parents the day she turned 18. Rachel's father Sean Canning is former Lincoln Park, New Jersey police chief and says his daughter is a'spoiled' liar who left on her own.

"LONDON, England -- (CNN) -- Ross Lovegrove is a world-famous industrial designer renowned for combining cutting edge, organic and sustainable designs with the newest manufacturing technologies. Lovegrove (left) and Craffonara with a prototype of the designer's ""alpine capsule,"" which is transparent on the inside and has a mirror on the outside. For his latest project, Lovegrove has teamed up with restaurateur and club owner Moritz Craffonara, who dreams of having a ""bed under the stars,"" nestled on the peaks of the Dolomite mountains. Reflecting Craffonara's passion for nature and art, Lovegrove has designed an ""alpine capsule"" which will rest atop Craffonara's private mountain. CNN joined Lovegrove and Craffonara in Italy, to explore the ideas behind the design for the unique concept of creating a ""bed under the stars."" CNN: How did this project come about? Ross Lovegrove: Moritz commissioned me to create the alpine capsule. He is a bit of a legend in this area. This whole mountain top where I am sitting is owned by Moritz. At the age of 22, he started bringing all the wood up the mountain on his own back. He is now in his early 60s and he looks younger than me, he is somebody who is a great example of what fresh air can really do for you. He has been running his lodge for all those years and now that he has some money available and he has decided to invest in something that could be a complete stimulus for a new way of thinking on the planet. Moritz leads the perfect life. He often gets in his little plane and flies to Venice for a coffee in St Mark's Square. That's a very good life style. CNN: What is the Alpine Capsule and how it will work? RL: The Alpine Capsule is a very typical idea about the way we might be able to live off grid. It's the idea that you can have an autonomous environment which can provide all the comforts you need, all the warmth and all the water you need, but absolutely off grid. Watch Lovegrove explain the concept ». It is a habitation that is completely transparent from the inside so you can see nature around you and the stars. From the outside, the capsule is a mirror that reflects the surrounding nature. It is meant to provide the experience of being warm and cozy and at the same time being one with the vast universe. It would be quite remarkable if at 4 o'clock in the morning you can leave this pod, it can open like a private jet, and you could walk about on the snow privately and see the stars. What do you think of the Alpine capsule? CNN: Where did your inspiration for the design come from? RL: I tried to bring the kind of autonomous habitation systems that exist on a space craft and bring them back to earth. The shape of the capsule looks like a space object, that's why I called it the Alpine Capsule. But it's not as synthetic as you would think. My capsule is the most adaptive statement to date. You can put it anywhere because it is fundamentally an alien. CNN: Do you think the capsule's aesthetic will fit into its environment? RL: It is indeed an alien mirror-like feature. But it actually is not an invasive thing, its something that we have gotten used to, like seeing an aircraft in the sky. The capsule looks like a mercurial drop. Also, I think the traditional buildings in the Alps, built from wood, are very beautiful. They work in total harmony with their environment and I'm not looking to interfere with that at all.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The Beverly Hills plastic surgeon who operated on Kanye West's mother a day before she died is in trouble with the Medical Board of California over several DUI cases and has had judgments against him in at least two malpractice cases, according to legal documents filed in California. Dr. Jan Adams has ""multiple convictions for alcohol-related offenses,"" medical board executive director David Thornton said in his complaint charging Adams with violating the Medical Practice Act. Adams has at least two convictions since 2003, when the doctor was put on probation and ordered to complete an alcohol counseling program, according to the complaint. The complaint, dated April 10, also cites the convictions as evidence for charges of unprofessional conduct and abuse of alcohol. It requests that the medical board revoke or suspend Adams' license. Watch why Adams is under scrutiny ». Sources familiar with the investigation told CNN that a settlement was reached regarding Adams' most recent DUI, in 2006, and the type of disciplinary action he should face from the medical board. The settlement was sent to the board on November 2, the sources said, but it will likely take a month for the board to finish its work. The sources also said the board probably will renew his license. Adams' medical license expires on April 30, 2008. Additionally, Adams has settled at least two malpractice suits, one for $250,000 and another for $217,000. Further details were not available. Adams has not responded to requests for comment about the medical board complaint or the malpractice suits. After telling TMZ.com that Donda West's death was an unforeseen circumstance unrelated to the surgery he performed, Adams released a statement refusing further comment about the death. TMZ.com, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner. The Los Angeles County Coroner's office said that Adams performed surgery on West, 58, on Friday. She was found unresponsive and in respiratory arrest at her home the following day and was pronounced dead that evening after being rushed to a nearby hospital. An autopsy on West's body was inconclusive pending the results of toxicology tests, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner said Tuesday. Adams is the host of Discovery Health's ""Plastic Surgery: Before and After"" and has appeared frequently on ""Oprah"" and other television shows.

"(Real Simple) -- Consult this handy calendar of what gifts to purchase, when -- courtesy of consumer-retail experts. October 28 to November 9. On and around the weekends before and after Halloween, some merchants tout ""early Black Friday"" sales with select ""door busters"" (like off-brand electronics marked down by about 30 percent) aimed at early-bird shoppers. Don't get too excited. Often these items are the sites' standard weekly specials, rebranded to fit the holiday-shopping season, says Brad Wilson, the founder of the deal site BradsDeals.com. Real Simple: 34 stocking stuffers under $30. Make the purchase only if the item meets two criteria: It's discounted by at least 20 percent, and you were planning to buy it anyway. Both weekends, you can find information about these sales by scanning ads in the Sunday newspapers or by checking your favorite retailers' websites. But wait until the following Monday to make purchases online. By then competitors may have matched prices or even started a price war. Real Simple: One-day holiday and Christmas shopping plan. November 25 to 27. Black Friday is traditionally the biggest shopping day of the season for brick-and-mortar stores -- less so for online purveyors. But massive general-interest sites, such as Amazon.com, host special Black Friday events throughout the weekend, along with ""lightning deals,"" price reductions that are offered for a short time period (last year a $230 video camera was marked down to $110). Be vigilant about sussing out these sales (which typically appear on the home page): Discounted items are often available for only a few hours or until they're sold out.

Most merchants -- from low-end to upscale -- want in on this action, and the deals tend to be broad, as opposed to discounts on specific items.

"By. Lizzie Parry. PUBLISHED:. 06:53 EST, 17 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 14:50 EST, 17 December 2013. If you're tired of having to dispose of your dead Christmas tree year after year, one entrepreneur might have the answer. Peter Inch is offering people the chance to rent a tree for the festive season before re-planting the fir at his Dorchester farm. The businessman has grown 3,000 trees, since setting up his business Rent A Tree five years ago. Rent A Tree is the brainchild of Peter Inch, left, and his wife Jo Hunt, right. The couple have grown 3,000 fraser fir trees at their Dorchester farm. The trees are carefully pruned and tended to by Mrs Hunt and her husband before they are delivered to households across the country at the end of November. Businesses and families across the country can then rent one, with Mr Inch delivering the trees at the end of November. Once he has picked up the trees in the first week of January, they are planted back in the ground in tubs and linked up to a watering system that revives them. The trees are fed a litre of water each day and are carefully pruned by the 52-year-old and his wife Jo Hunt, 42, ready for Christmas the following year. The aim is to reduce the number of people throwing trees away and cut down on the use of plastic replicas that are harmful to the environment. After testing a range of varieties the couple decided to grow Fraser Fir trees, because they don't drop their needles, have a better shape and are hardier than other breeds. Most Christmas trees have roots that grow around three feet into the ground - but Peter's trees have shallow roots so they can be grown in pots. The trees grow between 6ft and 7ft and cost £99 to rent. Mr Inch, pictured with two of the Christmas trees, rents each tree for a set fee of £99. As the festive season draws to an end, he picks up each of the trees, returning them to the farm to be re-planted. The trees are popular with families, including the Evans family, left, and businesses. Right, Gemma Wall decorates the tree rented by Humphries Kirk solicitors in Dorchester. Mr Inch said: 'The idea came from us seeing discarded Christmas trees, we saw people just leaving them in car parks after the festive period. 'We thought it was such a waste so we looked at ways that they could be reused time and time again. 'We tried different types of trees but in the end we settled on the Fraser fir. 'They take about 10 years to grow into a full 6ft sized tree so we purchased some from a grower in Scotland and and set up the business five years ago. 'We have up to 3,000 trees at the farm which are on a drip irrigation system that gives each one a litre of water per day. 'People can rent trees for as little as one or two days or from the end of November to the first week in January at a fixed price of £99. 'They do need to be regularly watered as they are a live plant but because they are alive, they do not drop any pine needles. The Evans family tree is decorated and ready for the festive period, left. And the rented tree at Humphries Kirk stands pride of place in the reception area. 'We drop the tree off and collect it at the end of the season before placing the pot back into a bigger container in the ground.

"This is the shocking moment balaclava-wearing protesters used iron bars to beat a huntsmaster unconscious during a meet. Mike Lane, Joint Master of the Tedworth Hunt in Wiltshire, had been attempting to calm saboteurs when he was punched, kicked, spat on and left needing hospital treatment. The attack happened after a fractious day of confrontations during a drag hunt on Saturday, when the masked group followed the hunt from the kennels in the morning. Scroll down for video. A protester wearing camouflage trousers and a balaclava attacks one of the huntsmen with what has been described as 'iron bars on a rope' The masked group are seen swinging iron bars as the man jumps back in defence before he is knocked out. Mike Lane can be seen lying on the floor (right) after he slipped over and while on the ground was kicked in the head twice and knocked out. The 39-year-old explained that he had become upset after they were spraying the dogs with citronella spray - a harmless solution used to train nuisance dogs. He said: 'We were packing up just after 4pm and it got quite violent. Five or six of them came across to where we were all parked and started to make a nuisance of themselves. 'I went over to try to calm it all down and one of them spat in my face. I was then punched by another and a scuffle broke out. 'I slipped over and on the ground one of them kicked me in the head twice and knocked me out.' He added that after that, he has no recollection of what happened, but recalls 'iron bars being swung on lengths of rope'. 'Luckily there were still enough people around who came to my aid and they ran back to their vehicles and drove off at speed. Mr Lane said the group had been 'harassing' them throughout the drag hunt and were'spraying the hounds with citronella spray' and he had remonstrated with them when the scuffle broke out. He was taken to the Great Western Hospital in Swindon and treated for concussion and several broken teeth. 'Lots of people videoed what happened, and it is quite disconcerting to see yourself being knocked out on film.' Police have now launched a major investigating into the incident, which happened near the village of Everleigh in Wiltshire as the meet closed, and are trying to identify those responsible. Mr Lane was taken to the Great Western Hospital in Swindon where he was treated for concussion and several broken teeth. A spokeswoman for Wiltshire Police said: 'The Tedworth Hunt had been out on a drag hunt and according to the hunt, a group of up to a dozen people - both men and women - wearing balaclavas had been harassing the hunt throughout the day. 'The protesters had left the scene by the time police arrived. 'We can confirm that a 39-year-old man from the Marlborough area who is involved with the hunt was assaulted and needed treatment at Great Western Hospital. Mike Lane, 39, is the Joint Master of the Tedworth Hunt and sustained injuries that left him needing hospital treatment following the attack in Everleigh, Wiltshire, on Saturday. 'The man was knocked to the ground and received injuries to the head and back and was briefly unconscious. Police officers gave him first aid until an ambulance arrived.

"By. Kerry Mcdermott. PUBLISHED:. 06:12 EST, 11 March 2013. |. UPDATED:. 13:41 EST, 11 March 2013. A couple who routinely drugged their toddler daughter so they could 'catch up on their sleep' have been given suspended prison sentences. The drug addict mother, 41, and father, 40, regularly gave their two-year-old daughter the liquid paracetamol Medised - intended for children more than twice her age - for a year and a half so she was less likely to wake in the night and disturb their sleep, a court heard. Gloucester Crown Court was told the little girl also sometimes had the sedative Diazepam - used to treat severe anxiety and agitation. The parents admitted cruelty after drugging their toddler with Medised so they could catch up on their sleep. The girl had to be fed through a. nasal tube when she was born due to problems caused by her mother's use. of Diazepam and the heroin substitute methadone while she was pregnant,. the court heard. Instead. of weaning their daughter off the tube, the couple, from Nailsworth in. Gloucestershire, continued to use it routinely because it was easier for. them, prosecutor Kannan Siva said. They. went on to give her Medised on a nightly basis between the ages of two. and a three and a half so they could sleep, he added. The. little girl was taken into the care of an aunt in June 2011 after her. 'plainly selfish' parents, who met in rehab, told a social worker what. they had been doing. Judge. Jamie Tabor QC criticised the couple for their'remarkably stupid' actions, and told them he would have jailed them were it not for the. fact it would deprive their daughter of weekly supervised visits from. her parents. The parents, whose identities cannot be revealed, walked free from court after being handed suspended sentences. Their offences were not malicious but. they were quite plainly selfish to spare themselves the tribulations of. parenthood, the judge said. 'Every. parent of a young child will have undergone sleepless nights because the. child is unsettled for one reason or another. You chose to adminster. Medised, which was not intended for a child that age, and you chose to. keep very quiet about it,' he said. 'I. see before me a wholly inadequate man who was rather struggling with. this child and a mother who was more concerned with herself than her. child,' the judge added. Both parents admitted being cruel to. their daughter between September 2009 and June 2011 by routinely. administering Medised - a liquid medicine typically prescribed to. children between the ages of six and 12 to relieve cold and flu. symptoms, fevers or headaches.

"Worthington allegedly asked police if they were familiar with 'that movie Avatar?' after his arrest. Aussie actor slapped with a desk ticket and released. By. Jade Watkins. PUBLISHED:. 17:13 EST, 24 February 2014. |. UPDATED:. 22:57 EST, 24 February 2014. The photographer accused of kicking Lara Bingle during a scuffle outside a New York bar on Sunday claims that the model attacked him first. Paparazzo Sheng Li's defence lawyer Ron Kuby says the 26-year-old lashed out at his client when he tried to take her picture, according to news.com.au. Speaking in Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday during Li's arraignment, Kuby said that Worthington then approached his client and punched him in the face four times. 'She attacked me': The photographer accused of 'kicking' Lara Bingle says model sparked scuffle and reveals that her partner Sam Worthington punched him in the face four times. 'Ms. Bingle was the one that attacked him,' Kuby said. 'She claims that Mr. Li was following her for four hours and then runs up and kicks her in the shins. In what world does that make any sense?' 'He was on the job taking pictures and Ms. Bingle got upset and ran half way up the block and attacked him. 'Her large famous boyfriend ran up and punched him four times in the face and Worthington doesn’t even get charged.' Relocation: Sam and Lara are currently staying in New York for what is thought to be a long period of time. Meanwhile, court papers state that Li allegedly tried to purposely trip the model up in an effort to get her picture. 'The defendant followed her on a public street for approximately four hours, kept getting in her way as she was walking down the street and was trying to trip her, which caused her to fear for her safety,' they state. The incident, which saw both Worthington and Li arrested, occurred outside the Cubbyhole bar in the West Village. Serious: The couple have been dating since last year but there have been rumours that they married in secret earlier this year. Speaking out: Lara posted this quote from Amy Poehler on her Instagram page on Tuesday. During the scuffle, Sam was said to have referred to Bingle as his 'wife', yelling at the photographer, 'you kicked my wife.' However, a friend of Lara's told the MailOnline on Monday: ‘He would have been speaking figuratively. They are definitely not married, as far as I know.’ Several reports earlier this year suggested that the couple had secretly married in Western Australia ahead of a romantic trip to the Maldives. Protective: The photographer claims that Worthington punched him four times in the face. They have since been seen wearing matching rings on their wedding fingers. Before Worthington was taken away in a police car following his arrest on Sunday it is said that the actor asked officers if they knew 'that movie Avatar?'

"By. Daily Mail Reporter. Last updated at 2:42 PM on 9th December 2011. Plastic manhole covers are being trialled in a drastic move by a local authority after scrap metal thieves stripped an area of the traditional road coverings. Councillors in North Somerset have ordered the trial after scores of the covers were stolen earlier this year. The move comes as scrap metal theft reaches almost epidemic proportions across the UK. Plastic replacement: The cheaper covers are being tested in North Somerset following a spate of thefts. Nineteen manhole and drain covers, which are made out of wrought iron and cost an average £4000, were stolen in just 48 hours across North Somerset in March. The new plastic replacements cost only £400 and are built to last for 15 years where their metal counterparts require replacement after five years. North Somerset Council is now working with motorcyclists in the Nailsea area to determine whether the plastic anti-skid cover are a safe alternative. North Somerset Council spokesman, Nick Yates, said: 'We are trialling a new type of cover in one location in Nailsea. It is made of plastic and is anti-skid. 'We are now working with a local motorcycle group to monitor and get feedback from the group into the performance of the cover over the coming months. Metal target: Manhole and drain covers are being stolen countrywide as the cost of scrap metal rises. 'The new covers are also less likely to be stolen as they have no scrap value. We are trialling one of the plastic covers and if this proves successful, we would hope to use them in other areas across the district.' Local residents have also complained that the covers at Church Lane in Backwell have yet to be replaced despite them being stolen nine months ago. The council has cordoned off the area around the missing covers to warn drivers and pedestrians, but residents say work needs to be done urgently to replace them. Some councils have reported the theft of manhole covers, wheelchair ramps and even children's playground equipment. Rail. companies are having power and signalling equipment stolen on a daily. basis across the network with British Transport Police admitting number. of thefts 'is huge'. As. police admit they are failing to keep up with the thefts around the. country sparked by the global rise in metal prices there is growing. pressure on the government to reform the 1964 Scrap Metal Dealers Act. The. coalition is considering licensing scrap metal dealers, banning them. from dealing in cash and giving police powers to close rogue traders. down. Ministers are considering the crackdown on the industry worth £5bn a year to the economy. It is thought that more than 15,000 tonnes of metal is stolen in the UK each year. One resident said: 'There is no street lighting to speak of along Church Lane and to have these open manholes surrounded by barriers in the middle of the road is a safety hazard. One of the cordons is just around a blind bend and when you come around the corner you are on top of it before you have noticed. 'I wouldn’t have thought it would have taken more than six to eight weeks to order replacements and get them fitted. 'I believe there are some concerns about the fitting of these manholes because of the utilities which may be under the road.

The 33-year-old, who has 37 caps, put behind him a poor Champions League last-16 performance against Barcelona in February, when he conceded a penalty and was sent off, to secure his place in the centre of the City defence in the title run-in. Sabella, whose team have often looked unbalanced with a brilliant attack and ordinary rearguard, has noted Demichelis's recent form as he looks to improve his defence for Argentina's tilt at a third World Cup triumph in Brazil. Another surprise call-up is Catania. midfielder Fabian Rinaudo, who won one of his four caps under Sabella in. 2011, and is regarded as cover in case regular midfielders Fernando.

"Paul Gambaccini said he went through 12 months of trauma when he was put on police bail over allegations of historic sexual offences. Veteran DJ Paul Gambaccini yesterday backed the Home Secretary’s plan to limit the time suspects can be kept on police bail without charge. The 65-year-old broadcaster, who spent a year on bail before being told last week he would not be prosecuted over historic sex abuse allegations, said he welcomed Theresa May’s proposals with ‘enthusiasm’. Concern over the issue has grown after a number of high-profile cases in which people were left in limbo for long periods before learning that they would not face trial. Scotland Yard was criticised after Gambaccini and entertainers Jim Davidson and Freddie Starr were left on bail for months over sex allegations in the Operation Yewtree investigation set up following the Jimmy Savile scandal. None were prosecuted. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck, 74, spent 11 months on police bail before being told this year that he would not be charged over sex abuse claims investigated by North Yorkshire Police. Elsewhere, dozens of journalists have been repeatedly bailed as police investigate allegations of phone hacking and bribery. Mrs May told chief constables yesterday that the Government would look at introducing a statutory limit on how long suspects could be kept on ‘pre-charge bail’. Paul Gambaccini, pictured in a radio studio in 1995, has welcomed proposals to limit the time suspects spend on police bail after his own 12 month ordeal. Theresa May, the Home Secretary, has announced a consultation into the way police bail is used to prevent suspects having to wait for months or years to learn if they will be charged. Freddie Starr (left) spent 18 months on police bail before he learned he would not be charged. Comedian Jim Davidson (right) was on police bail for eight months. Both were arrested under Operation Yewtree. Gambaccini, who was cleared last week after what he called ‘12 months of horror and trauma’, said: ‘I hope it leads to change that will prevent future injustices. If my ordeal can help prevent other persons from a similar fate, it will have been worthwhile.’ Figures compiled by BBC Radio 5 Live from 40 police forces show 71,526 suspects are on bail – 5,480 of them for more than six months. Operation Yewtree was set up in the wake of sex abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile. The force average is 1,788 suspects bailed, compared with 1,689 last year. Speaking at the annual conference of the College of Policing, which sets police standards, Mrs May said she was pleased senior officers were ‘developing evidence-based guidance to bring consistency, transparency and rigour to the way pre-charge bail is used in criminal investigations’. The Home Secretary added: ‘But in parallel we must also look at statutory time limits on the use of pre-charge bail to prevent people spending months or even years on bail only for no charges to be brought.’ Law Society president Andrew Caplen said there should be a limit of 28 days to stop people being left ‘in the wilderness’ as police decided whether to charge them. He said: ‘Not only does keeping someone on police bail interfere with their liberty, it means police investigations can be slow, making the justice system less efficient and with a negative effect on complainants and witnesses.’ John Harding, of legal firm Kingsley Napley, said: ‘This affects thousands of non-celebrities every day, often with devastating impact.’ College of Policing boss Chief Constable Alex Marshall said police bail was ‘an important tool’, but added: ‘There are concerns about variations in the time people remain on bail</s>","Paul Gambaccini, 65, was arrested under Operation Yewtree.

"By. Mario Ledwith. PUBLISHED:. 11:45 EST, 22 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 13:13 EST, 22 February 2013. A Chinese businessman was so angry about a filthy river in his hometown that he made an equally dirty offer: daring a local official £21,000 to swim in it. Jin Zengmin posted photos of the garbage-filled river on his blog, making the offer to local environmental protection chief Bao Zhenming. It comes as China's environment ministry admitted the country is home to 'cancer villages' - clusters of hundreds of people who have developed the fatal disease. Pollution: The Daqubang river is turned orange by iron discharged from nearby factories in Haiyan. Accused: Local media has accused companies of pumping toxic waste into the groundwater supply. Dirty: Green duckweed floats on the surface of Hanjiang River, running through the city of Wuhan. Mr Zengmin had grown frustrated about pollution in Rui'an city in China's eastern province of Zhejian. He said on his microblog that a. rubber shoe factory has been dumping waste water into the river and that. the area had an exceptionally high cancer rate. The challenge, made on Saturday, reflects a growing frustration among the Chinese public over widespread pollution and lack of governmental action. It quickly inspired at least one other offer, with another post appearing on Tuesday on an online forum offering a 300,000 yuan (£32,000) cash prize to the environmental protection chief in the nearby county of Cangnan if the official swam in polluted rivers there. Grey skies: A woman wears a mask as she walks in front of the CCTV building in Beijing in January when a blanket of smog covered the city. A Rui'an government spokesman would not say whether Mr Zhenming would accept the challenge. But he said the bureau had contacted Mr Zengmin and will take some measures, including working with residents to clean up trash in the river and putting up signs warning against dumping. He also said that the public should shoulder responsibility in protecting the environment and that the environmental protection bureau welcomes public supervision and participation in cleaning up local rivers. China's booming economy has caused serious water pollution, with a number of high-profile industrial accidents along major rivers. Hu Siyi, vice minister of water resources, said that 20 per cent of China's rivers were so polluted that their water quality was rated too toxic for human contact and that up to 40 per cent of the rivers were seriously polluted. Last month, around nine tons of aniline, a chemical used to make polyurethane, leaked into a river in northern China. The leak wasn't reported for five days, and by then it had contaminated the water supply of a city in a neighboring province. The government made it startling 'cancer villages' admission in its five-year plan for tackling air pollution. The document reads: 'In recent years, toxic and hazardous chemical pollution has caused many environmental disasters, cutting off drinking water supplies, and even leading to severe health and social problems such as 'cancer villages'. Campaigners have long called for the authorities to recognise the problem of contaminated soil, water and air, and to support those affected. Ma Jun, one of the countries leading environmentalists, told The Telegraph: 'I do think this shows a positive development. The recognition of the existence of problems is the very first step and the precondition for us to really start solving these problems.

"By. Laura Cox. The BBC has admitted programmes aired before the 9pm watershed are not always suitable for children. Under the corporation’s guidelines, programmes containing adult material such as nudity, swearing and violence should not be shown before this boundary. But the corporation’s governing body has now confessed, for what appears to be the first time, that not all programming shown an hour before the watershed is suitable for younger children - prompting experts to warn that this could signal the end of the 9pm threshold. Claim: Viewers of the popular soap Holby City, on at 8pm, 'would not have found the swearing unacceptable' The unexpected and damning admission was made by the BBC Trust following criticism from a viewer about sexually explicit swearing during the long-running and popular soap Holby City which is aired at 8pm. Rejecting the complaint that it was inappropriate for such language to be used before the watershed, the trust’s Editorial Standards Committee said in a report released yesterday that ‘regular viewers of this drama serial would not have found the use of the word ‘s***ging’ or the phrase ‘cut his b**** off’ unacceptable.’ It added: ‘Holby City starts an hour before the watershed, when viewers are aware that not all programming is suitable for younger children. ‘Parents and carers share responsibility with the broadcaster to decide what is suitable for children to view.’ The decision was made despite the BBC’s own editorial guidelines stating that programmes shown between 5.30am and 9pm must be suitable for children. Responding to the decision, Vivienne Pattison, of campaign group Media Watch, described the revelation as ‘shocking’ and ‘incredible’, while Miranda Suit, co-chair of charity Safermedia, warned that continual breaches of the watershed in this way would lead to a ‘public outcry’. Report: The unexpected and damning admission was made by the BBC Trust following criticism from a viewer about sexually explicit swearing during the long-running and popular soap Holby City which is aired at 8pm. Miss Pattison, 44, said the BBC Trust’s decision not to uphold the complaint meant parents could no longer trust that their children are safe from explicit material. The mother-of-two said: '’I’m really shocked that they have done this. According to their own broadcasting code the 9pm watershed signals the beginning of the transition towards more adult material so by this reckoning, what is it? 'I’m really shocked that they have done this. According to their own broadcasting code the 9pm watershed signals the beginning of the transition towards more adult material so by this reckoning, what is it?' Vivienne Pattison, Media Watch.

Offence was caused to a viewer during an episode aired in September last year which was watched by 4.66 million people, including about 186,000 children. During the programme a registrar says to a nurse: ‘You’re just s***ging her [referring to a consultant]. Actually forming a functioning relationship with a woman is like picking through a minefield.’ Later in the episode the consultant advises the registrar to ‘remind him that you have the power to cut his b**** off’ after a radiologist delays a patient’s X-Ray.

"By. Lorraine Candy. For the past two weeks I’ve been working away from home. I’ve been at ‘the fashions’, as a colleague’s young son calls the bi-annual catwalk shows of Milan and Paris. It’s written in my contract that I attend these runway collections, it’s business and I am obliged to be away. This means my husband is in sole charge of the four children, aged two to 11. It’s Mr Candy’s turn in the hot seat at air-traffic control: he’s wrestling with the dreaded domestic to-do list alone. Lorraine Candy: Should I be worried? Should I quit my job and stay within a five-mile radius of the kitchen to safeguard my marriage? Will everyone survive the triple school-run to get in on time? Will homework get done, hair get brushed, uniforms washed and hamsters fed? Will veggies get eaten and fizzy drinks be rationed? Will he leave me when I get back? This week I’ve learnt that apparently modern men resent being used as ‘daddy day care’. According to some they dislike it so much they hot-foot it out of a relationship, join internet dating sites and reveal their best body part is ‘their bum’. At least that seems to be the consensus of judgmental opinion I’ve read on the recent split between TV presenter Susanna Reid and her partner of 16 years Dominic Cotton (the man with the good bum). Columnists gleefully appeared to collude in the ridiculous view that it just wasn’t on for a working mum to expect her partner to take on equal childcare. How dare Susanna tackle a tough commute to work at BBC Breakfast, devote further time to training for Strictly Come Dancing, and then expect Dominic to be responsible for their three boys in her absence, the commentators crooned, as the news that Cotton was single and looking for love online broke. They concluded Cotton left because he resented his temporary role as house husband, that being the primary carer is really the woman’s job. This kind of thinking is illogical. Equal parenting is indisputably the most efficient way of organising childcare when both parents choose to or need to work. None of us know the reason Reid and her partner parted (it’s none of our business frankly) but to blame her career for the split is nonsensical. At least that seems to be the consensus of judgmental opinion I've read on the recent split between TV presenter Susanna Reid and her partner of 16 years Dominic Cotton (the man with the good bum). So should I be worried? Should I quit my job and stay within a five-mile radius of the kitchen to safeguard my marriage? It never crosses my mind — as I head for the airport for my short business trips and hand over control of the fearsome foursome — that Mr Candy may then feel the need to exchange me for a less demanding model. Can he cope in my absence? Of course he can, he is a man not a pot plant (no one asks if I’m going to be able to cope when he goes away for work, no one thinks I’ll resent the responsibility). He isn’t any less capable just because he hasn’t got a womb or his hair is shorter than mine. In fact, he seems to enjoy his rare mum-free existences.

"(CNN) -- Change is never pretty. And the change that results when 50 states step in to take on a job Washington has tried and failed to do can be especially messy. This is what's happening -- with a vengeance -- on immigration. In the past five years, there has been a virtual revolution in immigration lawmaking. And the result is not just chaos -- it's a lot of bad policy. States from Arizona to Virginia have enacted laws cracking down on illegal immigration. Some go after the immigrants; some target the businesses that hire them. Some rely on local police to do the job; others require that employers use the federal E-Verify system to check the immigration status of employees. Many of these statutes have been challenged in court, and the decisions that have been handed down are all over the map. The most controversial provisions of Arizona's 2010 immigration law, Senate Bill 1070, were put on hold by a federal judge before they could go into effect, and in April the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling. But when Alabama's similar law, passed in June, came before a federal judge, she came to exactly the opposite conclusion, upholding sections almost identical to those blocked by the 9th Circuit. And on Friday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals took yet a third view, blocking some provisions of the Alabama law but upholding others -- including the section that permits local police to ask about the immigration status of people they stop for other reasons. An immigration reform advocate who went to sleep five years ago when Congress last tried and failed to pass immigration reform wouldn't recognize the landscape today. The notion that immigration policy is a federal responsibility -- once widely accepted by both parties -- has been shattered, probably forever. Far from finding state immigration laws unconstitutional -- as many legal experts once insisted -- the Supreme Court's May ruling in the Whiting v. U.S. Chamber of Commerce case endorsed the principle that states can and should play a significant role in controlling illegal immigration. And policies once unthinkable to many are now commonplace. A full one-third of the states now require some or all employers to use the federal E-Verify system to check the immigration status of new hires. Four states have enacted measures modeled on Arizona's controversial policing law. Of course, it's understandable that states are stepping in to grapple with immigration: The system is dysfunctional, and voters want something done. The problem is that most state lawmakers respond to this clamor by intensifying state enforcement. But critical as enforcement is, enforcement alone won't solve the problem. To do that, lawmakers need to combine enforcement with fixes to the legal immigration system -- providing enough visas for immigrants who contribute to the economy, create jobs and keep our cities vital while also protecting U.S. workers. And these kinds of fixes are much harder for states to make. So instead, most simply crack down harder on the broken system. Consider what happened this year in Alabama, the state with the nation's toughest immigration law. The new measure touches nearly every aspect of life in Alabama: hiring, firing, policing, the criminal justice system, state contracts, schools and religion -- the aim being to make every aspect of life harsher and less hospitable for illegal immigrants.The two recent court decisions on the law are not the last word -- there will be many appeals. And in the meantime, chaos reigns across Alabama. Local law enforcement officials are at a loss, unsure who they should asking for immigration papers or where to house those they arrest -- most jails in Alabama are already full. Immigrants are fleeing the state in droves -- illegal immigrants but also legal residents who have unauthorized relatives and are afraid to lead police to their doors. Five percent of Hispanic children have stopped attending school. Employers -- particularly farmers -- are complaining desperately about labor</s>","Tamar Jacoby: States grappling with immigration by making own laws have made bad policy.

New development: The building was imploded to make room for an upscale apartment complex. Implosion: Observers snapped photos and shot video as the structure came down in a big cloud of dust. The hotel’s demolition comes at a time when the city wants to make its downtown area more residential, KTRK in Houston reported. The developers, The Finger Companies, said they considered preserving the hotel, but the structural elements would not have worked for the modern residential units they are planning to build. The Ben Milam was once used to serve train travelers who arrived from Union Station across the street. It was constructed around 1926, right before the Great Depression hit, by Houston attorneys John Crooker and R. Clarence Fulbright. The building's architect was James Ruskin Bailey, who also designed Houston's Public National Bank Building. Watch the historic Ben Milam Hotel being demolished. Historic structure: The Ben Milam was built in the late 1920s right before the Great depression hit. Cooling off visitors: In 1932 the Ben Milam became the first hotel in Houston to be fully air conditioned. Crooker and Fulbright named their hotel after the Kentucky-born soldier Benjamin Milan, who fought during the Texas Revolution and was killed in action in 1835. In 1932 the Ben Milan became the first hotel in Houston to be fully air conditioned. The hotel closed for business in the 1970s.

"By. Gerard Couzens. Former cocaine addict and alcoholic Diego Maradona has set alarm bells ringing after a slurring speech to journalists outside a restaurant in Argentina. The soccer legend spoke at snail's pace and repeated himself as he appeared to struggle to finish his sentences after a restaurant meal with ex Veronica Ojeda. Maradona, who dumped his former girlfriend four months before she gave birth to their 18-month-old son Diego Fernando, is said to be heading for a reunion with the PE teacher. Scroll down for video. Diego Maradona, speaking to journalists outside a restaurant in Buenos Aires, where he appeared to be slurring and struggled to finish his sentences. Mr Maradona spoke out to criticise an arsonist suspected of starting a blaze which destroyed part of his dad's home, saying it was the work of a'sick person' But it was his apparent state of intoxication outside Buenos Aires eatery El Corralon that caught the headlines as much as his tangled love life. Diego, 53, spoke out to criticise an arsonist suspected of starting a blaze which destroyed part of his father's home, saying it was the work of a'sick person'. His impromptu speech sparked concern among fans who took to Twitter to voice their worry. One, Gonzalo Armagno, wrote: 'Cocaine destroys brain. Look at poor Maradona.' Another, Cecilia Molina, said: 'Shame on the person who got him hooked on cocaine.' The retired footballer's daughter Dalma, a staunch critic of Veronica Ojeda, even reacted to the furore by retweeting messages from fans and admitting she felt ashamed at the furore. One of her retweeted messages read: 'How bad Maradona looks. Hadn't he stopped drinking with Veronica Ojeda?' Another said: 'What's that woman with your dad doing by letting him speak. And she says she looks after him!!!' His impromptu speech sparked concern among fans who took to Twitter to voice their worry. Maradona is said to be heading for a reunion with his former girlfriend, who he has a 18-month-old son with. Mr Maradona was suspended from football for 15 months in 1991 after testing positive for cocaine. He allegedly began using the drug in Barcelona in 1983. He suffered a heart attack following a cocaine overdose in April 2004 and was admitted to intensive care in a Buenos Aires hospital. He underwent a stomach reduction op the following year in Cartagena, Colombia. In March 2007 he was re-admitted to hospital in Argentina and treated for hepatitis and the effects of alcohol abuse and ended up being treated in a psychiatric clinic specialising in alcohol-related problems. Soon after his discharge in May 2007, he appeared on Argentine television and said he had quit drinking and not used drugs in two and a half years. Before his dinner date with Veronica Ojeda, his girlfriend of eight years, Mr Maradona was linked to a pretty young journalism student after she published snaps of them together on her Instagram account. The 25-year-old blonde later denied rumours they were a couple, insisting they were only friends and she would never date 'a person of the age of my dad.'

"(CNN) -- Brazil has delivered only four of the six stadiums that will be used in June's Confederations Cup, considered a dress rehearsal for next year's World cup, on time. One of the venues -- Recife's Arena Pernambuco -- opened just a day before FIFA's April 15 deadline, which comes precisely two months ahead of the start of the continental competition. The other three cities that succeeded in delivering arenas before the deadline are Fortaleza, Salvador and Belo Horizonte, which are all now scheduling games to test the facilities. After initially setting stadiums a deadline of December 2012, FIFA had to push the date back in the face of repeated delays. Brazil will host the Confederations Cup from June 15-30, using six different stadiums in six cities across the country. However, two of the designated arenas missed the deadline: the Estadio Nacional in Brasilia and the iconic Maracana in Rio de Janeiro. Operators of the stadium in Brasilia, Brazil's capital city, say the arena is not too far behind schedule, with its opening planned for April 21. The big question mark is over the legendary Maracana, which hosted the decisive World Cup finals clash in 1950. It has repeatedly pushed back deadlines and run over budget and although officials said last week that it should be ready by April 27, that date is not considered definite. After showing some largesse in the construction of stadiums for the Confederations Cup, FIFA's Secretary General has insisted that delays will not be tolerated when it comes to the World Cup itself. ""The deadline for the FIFA World Cup stadiums delivery stands firm as December 2013. There will be no compromise,"" Jerome Valcke said in a statement. All eyes will be on Brazil when it hosts the Confederations Cup, which will also be a trial run of infrastructure -- from hotels to airports and urban transport. More than half a million tickets have already been sold and many fans will want to travel from one city to another to follow their team. ""The next few weeks will be an acid test for the host cities,"" added Valcke, who has clashed with Brazilian authorities in the past when questioning the delay in preparations for FIFA's forthcoming events.

A brave schoolgirl who was forced to have her foot amputated after she was savagely attacked by her own pet dog has told how she is determined to 'keep smiling' despite her ordeal. Milly-Anne Hemley, 10, was so badly injured when Staffordshire bull terrier Rory turned on her out of the blue that surgeons had to remove her foot and the lower part of her right leg. But determined Milly-Anne, who spent Christmas in hospital following the attack at her home in Northamptonshire and has since been learning to walk on crutches, refuses to feel sorry for herself. 'Everyone calls me a little soldier and everyone says I'm brave - I don't feel brave, I just get on with it and keep smiling,' she said. Family pet Rory grabbed Milly-Anne's leg when she screamed as the dog attempted to bolt out of the house in Long Buckby when the front door was left open. The 10-year-old said the dog latched on to her leg and didn't let go. 'I remember my whole body shaking, I was hugging his back and saying: ""It's only me, Rory,""' she told the Daily Mirror. Milly-Anne's brother eventually managed to his sister away from the dog and shut her in the living room for safety, but not before Rory had attacked again, this time biting the little girl's other leg. She was rushed to hospital where surgeons battled for two hours to save the young girl's damaged limb, but her injuries were too severe and her mother Paula Warren was asked to give her permission to amputate. Ms Warren, 32, was at work at the time of the incident and had left son Braydon, 15, the eldest of her four children, in charge in her absence.

"(CNN) -- The North Koreans know how to put on a show and this year -- the 60th anniversary of the end of hostilities in the Korean War -- they've gone all out for the Mass Games. If you've toyed with the idea of going, this is the summer to do it. It's a lot easier to get into the Hermit Kingdom than you probably expect and the incredible spectacle that is the Mass Games officially runs until September 8, though it is often extended. You go in knowing there will be 100,000 performers -- gymnasts, dancers, acrobats -- that the music will be loud and there will be fireworks and strobe lights, but nothing prepares you for the sheer scale of the production. It's the Beijing Olympics opening night a dozen times over with a camp director and an unlimited budget. Half the people on the tour I went with opted to go a second night, hoping to catch some of the bits they missed the first time around. Why now is the time to go. Why go now? Because this could well be the last year that Arirang will be staged. Arirang is not the Mass Games -- it's the name of the theme the Games have followed for the last 10 years or so -- a Romeo and Juliet-like folk tale. So while there will almost certainly be a Mass Games next year, it may not follow this theme. What's more, without any anniversaries or significant dates to celebrate next year, it's expected to be far more low-key than the great pomp and ceremony that defines this year's show. Ethical debates persist over whether tourists should visit North Korea, a country with a poor human rights record. Critics say tourist dollars help the repressive government, but others say the tourism money generated in North Korea is minimal. To mark the 60th anniversary of the Korean War armistice -- what North Koreans call the victory in the Fatherland Liberation War -- no expense has been spared. New at the Mass Games. Regulars at the world's largest choreographed gymnastics performance say this year's show has plenty of new material, with familiar acts given a new twist. ""I've been about 50 times and 50% of it was different this year,"" says Simon Cockerell of Beijing-based Koryo Tours. ""There are whole new acts and there's a lot more technology -- the digital screens, the arches on top of the stadium, all that's new."" That new technology had a major hiccup the night I visited, July 27 -- Victory Day. Five minutes into the 90-minute show there was a total blackout. Power outages are everyday occurrences in Pyongyang, but to have one at such a high-profile event was unusual. The spectacle was just kicking off -- a wall of students on the far side of the stadium, the ""human pixels,"" were flipping through books of colored cards to flash up messages and images, giant strobe lights rolled across the arena, the music was pounding, thousands of performers surged across the stadium -- and we were plunged into darkness. Only the night before North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had sat in the stadium watching the very same performance with Chinese Vice-President Li Yuanchao. Fortunately for show managers, the blackout didn't happen then. We sat in silence. No one booed, no one jeered and five minutes later when the power came on and the show began again -- from the beginning -- there was a round of applause. ""People live with blackouts all the time,"" says Cockerell. ""It's a sign that someone has been in North Korea a while when the lights go out and they just keep talking or doing whatever they were doing."" Military messaging dominates.

"Lynda Bellingham poignantly described the details of the Christmas she would never see during her final TV interview which was screened today. The actress had hoped to spend one more festive season with her family after choosing to end treatment for her cancer, but died at the weekend just days after she had made her decision public. In the interview for Loose Women - the show on which she had been a regular panellist - she assured friends and colleagues all would be 'fine' and said she wanted to be remembered for her honesty. Scroll down for video. In an interview filmed two weeks ago, Lynda Bellingham told of her desire to spend one final Christmas with her family before she stopped chemotherapy. The interview with presenters Janet Street Porter (left) and Coleen Nolan (centre), in which Lynda told of her plans to end her treatment, was filmed just days before her death. Presenters told of their shock at Lynda's death today, insisting that she looked full of energy when she filmed the interview two weeks ago. Bellingham died in the arms of her husband Michael Pattemore at the age of 66 after her cancer spread from her colon to other parts of her body. She recorded her last interview earlier this month and told how she was 'obsessed' with Christmas and was determined to see one more. 'Bloody right I am! I am. I AM,' she insisted, during the interview with Janet Street Porter and Coleen Nolan in front of a studio audience which included Pattemore. 'We're going to go to the hotel and have the meal but just my little bit of control - we're going home for pudding and presents, it's exciting. 'My only problem is getting the presents - my sister Jean has been absolutely amazing and I keep sending him (Michael) out for bizarre things.' Bellingham told of her desire for a real Christmas tree, although her husband was not a fan. 'He's spent years trying to put me off a real tree and we're very lucky as we live in a converted psychiatric hospital which has got a really tall ceiling. All I've ever wanted is a real tree. 'No don't make me sweep up the pine needles, oh my goodness',' she joked, mimicking Pattemore. 'Hey I'm getting one, I'm getting a real tree. He'll just have to struggle out of the window with it afterwards, that's fine.' At the end of the interview, the studio audience and the two presenters rose to give Lynda a standing ovation. The interview was shown today on a special tribute show in which presenters (left to right) Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan and Jamelia read out comments praising Lynda sent in by viewers. Coleen was overcome with emotion while watching the interview and had to leave the set during filming. Bellingham was given a standing ovation as she entered the studio and went on to say how she wished to be remembered: 'Just as an honest person. Honesty. We've been through this as Loose Women - you can't do Loose Women unless you're honest. 'You can't hide anything, it really is honest when we answer questions. That's why I felt I could write about it and people would trust.' 'Trust is a huge thing. Not just as an actor, not just as a lover, not just as a wife, that trust thing.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to pardon jailed oligarch and Kremlin opponent Mikhail Khodorkovsky, he said Thursday. Speaking to reporters after a news conference, Putin said Khodorkovsky had written a letter appealing for a pardon, citing humanitarian factors. The announcement came a day after Russian lawmakers backed a sweeping amnesty law and as the nation's human rights issues are in the spotlight as the country prepares to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi in February. The amnesty, to mark the anniversary of the adoption in 1993 of Russia's post-Communist constitution, will be applied to thousands of Russian prisoners, the state-run RIA Novosti reported. ""We have several dozens of amnesties recently,"" Putin told reporters. As for Khodorkovsky, Putin said that he has been imprisoned for more than 10 years, which he called a ""serious punishment."" ""His mother is ill, and I think, taking into consideration all these circumstances, one can take an appropriate decision,"" Putin said. ""And a decree will be signed shortly after pardoning him."" Khodorkovsky's son told CNN Thursday that he was not able to substantiate Kremlin assertions that there is a planned pardon for his father. During a telephone interview, Pavel Khodorkovsky said he had yet to talk to his father or his father's attorneys. ""With Putin things are always personal,"" he said.

"A 17-year-old boy sent to live with his great-grandmother is accused of killing her Friday with help from his cousin. Joda Cain was sent to live with Jacqueline Bell in an effort to escape problems he’d been having at home, instead he killed her with help from his cousin Micus Ward, 19, and stole her Lexus, officials charged. The two murder suspects took cops on a high speed chase at speeds as high as 135MPH before they were apprehended. Cops pulling them over were initially unaware of the murder, only finding out after calling in the stolen car. 'He's not that person': Joda Cain's mother insists her son (pictured with the gun) with cousin Marcus Ward (back) wouldn't kill anyone. Ms Bell died of blunt force trauma, officials said. They have not yet specified a murder weapon. Mr Cain’s mother sent him this summer to live with Bell because he was having problems back home in Kansas City, she told KSHB. ‘He needed to get away he was having issues, he was getting in trouble,’ the mother, who asked not to be identified, explained. The young boy was thriving out west, even taking part in sports. ‘He was happy, he was happy,’ the devastated mother said between tears. ‘Everything was going good and he was back to playing football and everything was great for all I knew.’ Loving great grandmother: Jacqueline Bell agreed to take Mr Cain in to help him get over troubles he was having back home. Ms Bell spoiled the troubled teen, his mother told the station. Her generosity knew no limits, she even bought Mr Ward a plane ticket to come visit. However, a series of pictures posted to Micus Ward’s Facebook page the night he arrived showed a completely different Jona Cain than the one described by his mother. Clouds of smoke, alcohol, and a chilling picture of him pointing a gun with a wad of money in his mouth appear on the social media site. 'He's spoiled rotten': Mr Cain's mother said Ms Bell spoiled her son rotten, that the two loved each other very much. Formerly imprisoned: Marcus Ward bragged on his Facebook page about a prior incarceration. Cops found his dead great-grandmother the next morning. The two young men were caught a short time later in the dead woman’s car, pulled over after the high-speed chase for dangerous driving. Police discovered the woman was dead after reporting the car stolen. The two teens were immediately arrested. Despite officials saying Mr Cain was involved in Ms Bell’s death, and being pulled over in her stolen car, his mother insists he didn’t do it. ‘He's not that person,’ she told KSHB. ‘He's really not. He's not perfect, he's spoiled rotten but my God he would never, never do that to her, he'd never do that to anybody.’ Change of scenery: Joda Cain was thriving away from home, staying out of trouble and playing football.

"Bowe Bergdahl is reportedly refusing to speak with his family, despite getting a letter from his sister, as he recovers in an Army hospital in Germany. This comes as officials in his hometown Hailey, Idaho, canceled a homecoming celebration for the American prisoner of war. Officials cited several death threats his parents, Bob and Jani Bergdahl have gotten since the controversial release of their son, who was freed in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees. Many in Hailey suspect the celebration was also canned because of a massive backlash, both national and local, over reports that Bergdahl deserted his post in Afghanistan before he was captured. The FBI is investigating. death threats that Mr and Mrs Bergdahl have received from. people furious about the deal that saw him released from captivity. Fueling the anger is Mr Bergdahl's use of both Pashto and Arabic. language during a White House press conference with President Barack. Obama. Bergdahl has told military officials that he was kept locked in a shark cage in total darkness for weeks at a time and tortured as punishment for twice trying to escape his Taliban captors. Threats: Federal authorities have confirmed that threats have been made against Bob Bergdahl and his wife Jani following their son's controversial release. Moment of release: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl was shown struggling to adjust his eyes to the light at the moment he was released in a video released by a Taliban website. Former colleagues accused him of being a deserter. Bergdahl said his captors kept him in a cage for weeks on end in total darkness (stock photo) The Wall Street Journal reports that Bergdahl doesn't yet want to speak with his parents on the phone. The New York Times quotes military sources as say he has gotten a letter from his sister, but has so far declined to respond. He also does not have access to news media and does not know the political controversy that his release has caused in the U.S. Military officials are planning a re-union with his family at a medical facility in Texas, though they say he is not yet psychologically ready for such a reunion. The Times reports that Sergeant Bergdahl has begun opening up about his ordeal to a team of doctors and psychologists that are caring for him. 'It’s safe to assume he was held in harsh conditions. These are Taliban, not wet nurses,' one senior official said. Among the revelations is that he was locked in a shark cage for weeks at a time as punishment, military sources told the newspaper. Bergdahl said he tried to escape at least once, possibly twice, during his five years being held by the Taliban and later the extremist Haqqani network in Afghanistan. As their son recovers, Mr and Mrs Bergdahl have kept out of the public eye after getting several death threats. Officials won't describe the nature of the threats, but acknowledge that threats have been made. The Bergdahl have not been seen publicly since announcing with President Barack Obama that their son had been freed. 'We are working jointly with our state and local. partners and taking each threat seriously,' FBI Special Agent William. Facer told CNN in an e-mail on Saturday. The threats come in the wake of controversy. coming from the families of soldiers who were killed while supposedly. looking for Bergdahl, who is said to have deserted his post, which is what led to his capture by Taliban forces in 2009.

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court is still trying to link Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, his son and his brother-in-law to rapes, but it does not yet have enough evidence to do so, prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Tuesday. It has evidence that rapes have taken place in Libya's civil war, he said, but he cannot prove Gadhafi ordered them. The court issued arrest warrants Monday for Gadhafi, his son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi on other charges. Saif Al-Islam Gadhafi is a close adviser to his father. His arrest warrant came two days after his 39th birthday. Al-Sanussi serves as Gadhafi's head of intelligence. The warrants are ""for crimes against humanity,"" including murder and persecution, ""allegedly committed across Libya"" from February 15 through ""at least"" February 28, ""through the state apparatus and security forces,"" the court said in a news release. The court could file charges against ""one or two other names, but in principle the first investigation focuses on these individuals,"" Moreno-Ocampo said Tuesday. The court is not asking international forces operating in Libya to arrest the suspects, he said, explaining that Libya has the primary responsibility to do so as a United Nations member. NATO confirmed in a news conference that it is not seeking to arrest anyone, as that is not part of its mission. Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard of NATO gave a mixed assessment of the mission to protect civilians, saying Libyans were writing ""Thank you, NATO"" on their roofs. But, he said, Gadhafi's forces were using civilians as human shields, making NATO operations ""more difficult, but not impossible."" And he said NATO had reports that government forces had ""put down very severely"" attempts to demonstrate against Gadhafi's rule. ""Security forces continue to inflict pain and harm on the population,"" Bouchard said at a briefing in Naples, Italy, where Operation Unified Protector is based. NATO struck civilian and military locations in the Badr Al-Osta Milad area of Tripoli on Tuesday, Libyan state TV reported without further details. Elsewhere Tuesday, rebels attacked a government weapons depot some 30 kilometers south of Zintan, an opposition stronghold in western Libya. It was a location that had previously been a target of NATO attacks. Two people died and four were injured in the fighting, according to Khalid Shhop, a doctor stationed at the depot. Rebels overtook government forces and were later seen carting away ammunition, he said. At the International Criminal Court, Moreno-Ocampo insisted it is only a matter of time until Gadhafi is arrested, pointing out that Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic was finally seized more than 15 years after a warrant for his arrest was issued. ""The arrest warrants are not going away,"" he said, noting that 161 warrants had been issued in connection with the Yugoslav wars of the early 1990s -- and that 160 suspects have been seized. Libyan rebels could also face arrest warrants, Moreno-Ocampo said. But ""by far the greatest crimes committed in Libya are committed by the Gadhafi forces,"" he said, explaining why the court investigation began with them. And he batted away questions from reporters about whether an ICC arrest warrant would discourage Gadhafi from stepping down, saying the decision to investigate him came from a unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution, not the court. It was ""not our idea,"" </s>","NEW: Rebels attack a weapons depot near the western city of Zintan.

"House Republicans have. passed legislation to shut down a program by President Barack Obama. granting deportation relief to immigrants brought here illegally as. kids, with many calling the bill a dead-end as the Senate leaves for summer break. The legislation that passed 216-192 late. Friday could put more than 700,000 immigrants who've received temporary. work permits in line for deportation. It also would block Obama from awarding work permits to other immigrants here illegally. House Republicans have passed legislation to shut down a program by President Barack Obama granting deportation relief to immigrants brought here illegally as kids. The. bill was supported by conservatives who demanded it as their price for. backing a separate measure dealing with the crisis of unaccompanied. minors flooding the border. The Senate has already adjourned for Congress' summer recess so neither bill stands a chance of becoming law. As CBS notes, President Barack Obama and Senate Democracts have said they won't even consider said legislation. Obama called the move political theater 'just so they can check a box before they're leaving town for a month. A day after. GOP leaders pulled the border bill from the floor in a chaotic retreat,. tea party lawmakers were enthusiastically on board with the new $694. million version and a companion measure that would shut off a program. created by Obama granting work permits to immigrants brought here. illegally as kids. The second bill also seemed designed to prevent the. more than 700,000 people who've already gotten work permits under the. program from renewing them, ultimately making them subject to. deportation. The spending bill passed 223-189. late Friday, with only four Republicans voting ""no"" and one Democrat. voting 'yes.' A vote on the second measure was expected later in the. night. 'It's dealing with the issue that the. American people care about more than any other, and that is stopping the. invasion of illegal foreign nationals into our country,' said Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. 'And we got to yes.' But. Obama said no. 'They're not even trying to solve the problem,' the. president said. 'I'm going to have to act alone, because we do not have. enough resources.' Obama said he would. reallocate resources where he could, while making clear his options were. limited without congressional action. The. moves in the House came on what was to have been the first day of. lawmakers' five-week summer recess, delayed by GOP leaders after their. vote plans unexpectedly collapsed on Thursday. Senators had already left. Washington after killing their own legislation on the border crisis, so. there was no prospect of reaching a final deal. Rep. Steven King of Iowa, a leading immigration hardliner, said he was'very satisfied' with the results. But three months before. midterm elections, House Republicans were determined to show that they,. at least, could take action to address the crisis involving tens of. thousands of unaccompanied minors fleeing violence and poverty in. Central America to cross illegally into South Texas. 'It. would be irresponsible and unstatesmanlike to head home for the month. without passing a bill to address this serious, present crisis on the. border,' said Rep.

"Rock inscriptions and tomb carvings have shed light on the large beasts that thrived in Egypt before they were wiped out around 6,000 years ago. The etchings depict horned hartebeest and oryx, as well as other big mammals, that lived in the Nile Valley before its ecology changed dramatically, and the country became drier overall. Experts claim that 37 large bodied mammals including lions, wild dogs, elephants and giraffes, lived in Egypt before the time of the pharaohs which began in 3,100 BC - compared to just eight now. Scientists studied depictions of animals in Egyptian artefacts to assemble a detailed record of the animals present in the Nile Valley going back to pre-dynastic times. This 5,150 year-old ceremonial stone palette is ramed by two wild dogs clasping one another’s paws and features ostrich, hartebeest, oryx and giraffes. Scientists have used depictions of animals in Egyptian artefacts to assemble a detailed record of the animals present in the Nile Valley going back to pre-dynastic times. The study shows species extinctions in the area - probably caused by a drying climate and an exploding human population - made the ecosystem progressively less stable. One of the artefacts examined was a 5,150 year-old ceremonial stone palette housed in a museum at Oxford University. It is framed by two wild dogs clasping one another’s paws and features ostrich, hartebeest, wildebeest, ibex, oryx and giraffes. The palette also features mythical creatures including serpent-necked panthers and what is thought to be a griffin - a legendary bird with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. The etchings depict horned hartebeest (pictured left in the Namibian desert) and oryx (pictured right) as well as other cumbersome animals that lived in the Nile Valley before its ecology changed dramatically and the country became drier. Experts say that 37 large bodied mammals also including lions, wild dogs, elephants and giraffes lived in Egypt before the time of the pharaohs which began in 3,100 BC - compared to just eight now. Computational analysis identified five episodes when dramatic changes occurred in Egypt’s mammals, three of which coincided with extreme environmental changes as the climate shifted to more arid conditions. These droughts also coincided with upheaval in human societies such as the collapse of the Old Kingdom around 4,000 years ago and the fall of the New Kingdom about 1,000 years later. Dr Yeakel said: ‘There were three large pulses of aridification as Egypt went from a wetter to a drier climate - starting with the end of the African Humid Period 5,000 years ago when the monsoons shifted to the south. ‘At the same time human population densities were increasing and competition for space along the Nile Valley would have had a large impact on animal populations.’ The most recent major shift in mammalian communities occurred about 100 years ago. The analysis of predator-prey networks showed species extinctions in the past 150 years had a disproportionately large impact on ecosystem stability. Another stone tablet, kept in the British Museum, shows human hunters armed with bows, spears, clubs and lassoes stalking lions, gazelles, hartebeest and an ostrich.

"Alan Irvine had to endure a barrage of abuse from his own supporters as he headed down the tunnel at the end of what may prove to be his last game as head coach of West Bromwich Albion. Irvine’s seventh defeat in nine Premier League games was inflicted by two second-half goals from Stoke striker Mame Diouf. Both were deflected, which perhaps sums up the Scot’s luck at present, and time will tell if chairman Jeremy Peace’s notoriously itchy trigger finger holds off long enough for him to stay in charge for the trip to West Ham on New Year’s Day. Afterwards, Irvine insisted that he is still capable of turning the club’s fortunes around but admitted that the decision is out of his hands.

"Washington (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates says he will urge President Obama to veto a coming $726 billion defense authorization bill if it contains funding for unwanted projects Gates has been trying to cut for years. Gates has been vocal about financial reform at the Pentagon, trying to rein in some big-ticket contracts and telling Congress to stop spending money on C-17 transport planes that are not needed and a $485 million alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The JSF engine program -- already delayed and over budget -- could end up costing taxpayers billions of dollars, according to Gates. But with jobs at stake, Congress has ignored those requests for years and continued to appropriate funds for the C-17 and a second F-35 engine. ""The detailed conditions they [Congress] have imposed on the overall JSF program would make it essentially un-executable and impose unacceptable schedule and budget costs,"" Gates said Thursday at a Pentagon briefing. ""As I have stated repeatedly, should the Congress insist on adding funding for a costly and unnecessary JSF extra engine or direct changes that seriously disrupt the JSF program, or impose additional C-17 aircraft, I will strongly recommend that the president veto such legislation,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- PayPal has backed off an online spat with humor blog Regretsy after getting withering Web feedback for shutting down a drive to buy holiday gifts for children in need. And the online payments service is even chipping in to help buy a few more gifts after temporarily shutting down the Secret Santa fund because the for-profit site was running it. ""(W)e can confirm that the funds have been released and we are working directly with the account holder on this matter,"" a PayPal representative said via e-mail. ""We are also making a donation to Regretsy to help families in need this holiday season. We're very sorry this occurred."" Run by actress-comedian April Winchell, Regretsy is a snarky blog created primarily to mock what it considers awkward, ugly or otherwise head-turning offerings on the arts-and-crafts site Etsy. But, perhaps in a bid for some good karma, the site maintains a charity fund that has given money to causes from breast-cancer research to Etsy community members in need. Last month, Winchell, who uses the pen name ""Helen Killer"" on the blog, put out a call for community members who knew of children at risk of not getting gifts this Christmas. On December 1, she announced that 200 children had been approved and put out a call for donations -- one that she wrote raised thousands of dollars in a few hours. ""You people make me sick,"" she wrote, mocking, as she frequently does, the tone some Etsy users take when they find their work has been featured on Regretsy. ""Funded. Overfunded, in fact. In just a few hours. We now have enough money to make gifts to the families, as well as these kids. Good job a--holes."" Then came the trouble. On Monday, Winchell wrote that PayPal, which was processing the donations, shut down the drive because she had used a ""Donate"" button that she learned is only for nonprofit groups. She said she had a ""very long and jaw-dropping conversation with an incredibly condescending representative,"" who told her she had to refund donations. She wrote she hatched a plan to return the donations, then ""sell"" the toys that had already been purchased to the donors, only to be told that, too, violated PayPal rules. PayPal said it has clear guidelines for any business that uses the service to collect donations. (The statement did not directly address whether Regretsy had violated those guidelines, saying it can't comment directly on accounts due to privacy policies). The representative said such guidelines are required by law. ""We appreciate that this can be an inconvenience, but we have a responsibility to all our customers -- both donors and recipients; or buyers and sellers,"" the PayPal rep said. ""In this instance, we recognized our error and moved as swiftly as possible to fix it."" In a post Tuesday afternoon, Winchell thanked her supporters. ""I would also like to say that I did not expect this kind of global outpouring of support, and I truly believe that had you not all made your voices heard, no one from Paypal would have ever felt compelled to make this right,"" she wrote, noting that ""Regretsy"" had become a top trending topic on Twitter. ""There is no real support or appreciation for the consumer anymore. The customer is always wrong. ""I am extremely grateful to all of you for your efforts. If Paypal is sincere about allowing us to make these gifts, you will have made a difference for 200 children and their families this holiday season."" In an email later Tuesday to CNN, Winchell said she'd had an ""encouraging"" conversation with PayPal and that they were still discussing a donation to the fund.

Tony Blair was heckled by protesters who branded him a 'war criminal' as he gave a graduation speech at an American college. The former British prime minister, 59, had to break off his his address as he spoke to 400 graduates and their guests at Colby College, in Maine. Protesters shouted phrases such as 'warmonger' and 'You're a war criminal' during his speech. One person was arrested. Guest of honour: Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair shakes hands with a Colby College graduate after giving the commencement address. Audience: The ceremony was attended by 400 students as well as their friends and family. In his address, Blair appealed for international cooperation and for people to try to understand other cultures. The former premier, who served from 1997 to 2007, backed the U.S. in it so-called war on terror and took Britain to war in Afghanistan and Iraq. His decision to send troops to topple Saddam Hussein prompted widespread criticism, including a massive anti-war march in London which attracted more than one million demonstrators. But, while he has long been dogged by demonstrations in Britain carrying out stunts like trying to arrest him, it is the first time his appearances in the U.S. have been hijacked by protesters. In the States, where initial opposition to the Iraq war was much smaller, Blair had long garnered widespread respect as a dynamic leader who stood by America. Furthermore, Americans usually focus their ire on George W Bush and prefer to see Blair as a man misled by the former president than someone who may have sought to deceive others. Flashpoint: Protesters outside the London Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war where Blair gave evidence in 2010. Anger: Protesters clash with police as Blair attends his book signing at a bookstore in Dublin in September 2010. Anger at Blair stems from the fact his Labour government sold the case for war on a so-called 'dodgy' dossier based on false information claiming Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. Much of it was found to be plagarised from a PhD thesis and many protesters claim Blair knew its contentions - such as that Iraq could deploy chemical warheads within 45 minutes - were lies.

At its most popular between the 1950s and the 1980s, the adventures of cow pie-eating Desperate Dan and Korky the Cat sold two million copies a week. But competition from computer games and the internet has seen sales plummet to fewer than 8,000 in the second half of 2011. Scroll down for video. 'Struggled in digital age': The very first The Dandy comic (left) was published on December 4, 1937, and the brand was still going strong nearly ten years later (right), but has suffered a serious slump in modern times. Outstripped: The Dandy celebrated its 3,000th issue (left) on May 22, 1999, beating the previous record held by Comic Cuts, but has seen sales plummet in recent years to fewer than 8,000. Publishers DC Thomson are considering the comic’s future – and even the possibility of moving Desperate Dan to the pages of The Dandy’s long-time rival and sister title, The Beano. A spokesman for the Dundee-based publisher confirmed it was considering closing the magazine but said the most popular characters would continue to exist online. He said: ‘There are many challenges within the industry at present, but we’re excited that the digital revolution has also given us an opportunity to innovate and develop. ‘We’re confident that future generations will continue to enjoy our much-loved products and characters.’ Cartoon capers: At its most popular between the 1950s and the 1980s, the adventures of cow pie-eating Desperate Dan (above) and Korky the Cat sold two million copies a week.

In 2007, it was rebranded as Dandy Xtreme, a fortnightly version of the comic, and in 2010 its creators introduced celebrity-themed strips starring well-known figures such as Simon Cowell and Jeremy Clarkson.

"By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 13:03 EST, 25 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 13:04 EST, 25 February 2013. Nearly 28 years since two teenage sisters vanished without a trace, their family is still searching for them - and has now turned to Facebook in a bid for answers. Rozlin Abell was 18 when she left her home in Bethany, Oklahoma on July 25, 1985 saying she was going to look for jobs with her 15-year-old sister Fawn in tow. Their brother Otto remembers the girls heading for the door, with one shouting: 'Hurry up. They're waiting for us down the street' - and it was the last words he ever heard them speak. There have been no leads into their. disappearances but the family has not given up; they have now turned to. social media and have ploaded artists' renditions of what the girls would look like today. No trace: Fifteen-year-old Fawn Abell, left, and her 18-year-old sister Rozlin, right, have been missing since July 25, 1985, when they went to look for jobs, and investigators have no leads in the case. The pictures of the women, who would now be 46 and 43, are splashed across the family's Facebook group, which has gathered 1,000 supporters since it was set up by a family friend. 'To this day we still don't know what happened to them,' their brother, Otto Abell, told News 9. 'It keeps you up at night and you just go on and on about different things. It's been this long, I'm pretty sure something bad happened to them.' No trace of the girls has been found since they disappeared in the middle of the day that July. A missing persons report was only. placed for Fawn as she was a juvenile at the time, and Lt. Austin. Warfield, who is investigating the case, told NewsOK she was listed as a runaway for some time. But the girls' families are certain. there was foul play involved as they often hitchhiked, and asked investigators to see if any bones. found in the area matched the girls, but they have not. Today: An artist's rendition of how the women would look now - Fawn aged 43, left, and Rozlin aged 46, right. DNA swabs have been taken from Otto Abell and his mother, but so far they have not matched up with any unclaimed human remains at labs in the country, Warfield said. There has also been no activity on Rozlin Abell's Social Security number since July. 1985. She was eventually listed as a missing person when her parents said they had not heard from her. 'We don't know if the girls are still. alive,' Warfield said. 'We don't know if any human remains of the girls. have been found and not identified yet, and we don't know if the. remains are somewhere in a field.' The family does not know what jobs the. girls were going to look at that day and did not know where they were. going. But they were known to hitchhike around the area.

"A Romanian princess accused of running cockfights at her Oregon ranch has pleaded guilty to running an illegal gambling business with her husband. Irina Walker admitted to the gambling charges on Wednesday under a plea deal in which charges of animal fighting and conspiracy to violate the animal welfare act were dismissed. Walker, whose father King Michael I was forced to abdicate by communists in 1947 and raise his family in exile, was arrested last summer. Plea deal: Romanian princess Irina Walker, left, and her husband John Walker, a retired sheriff's deputy, right, pleaded guilty under a plea deal to running an illegal gambling business. In court yesterday the 61-year-old admitted that she had profited from the fights in which roosters had knives strapped to their legs and then fought to the death. 'I provided food and beverage, your honor, and the location.' she told district judge Michael Mosman. Walker and her husband John, a retired sheriff's deputy, were accused of hosting at least ten cockfighting fights in a barn at their Irrigon ranch, which is about 175 miles from Portland. Assistant U.S. attorney Stephen Peifer said the Walkers charged spectators $20 to enter, and attracted crowds of more than 100. Peifer said that Irina Walker had initially provided food for the spectators, but her husband brought in outside catering to provide tacos when her dishes proved unpopular. Her 68-year-old husband, who worked for the Coos County sheriff's office from 1998 to 2008, told the judge an experienced cockfighting referee had approached him about staging fights. Exile: Irina Walker's father, former King of Romania Michael I, with his wife and some of his daughters in 1955. Regal past: Before Walker's family were forced into exile by communists, they lived in several palaces including Peles Castle, which was used as a summer residence by the Romanian royals from 1883 to 1947. At first the fights were held outside, but later Walker had a barn-like structure built, which he told the judge had been for hay. Walker, who owned several guns, was allegedly in charge of security, and also arranged for a company to provide portable rest rooms. The people who brought. roosters to fight paid $1,000 to enter, and the pool ranged from $10,000. to $18,000. The person whose roosters won the most fights took home the. money, except for the 10 percent takeout kept by the referees. More. than a dozen other people were indicted in the case. Charges against. the woman who made the Mexican food were later dropped and two. defendants - Ruben Saltos Godina, known as Chino; and. Antonio Dominguez Robles, known as Tono - have not yet been caught. Everyone else pleaded guilty, either in Oregon or Washington state. Walker and her husband John, had accepted plea deals in the case, and are due to be sentenced on October 22. They were released to await sentencing. Accusations: The Walkers are accused of staging cockfights at their ranch, in which spectators paid $20 to watch the barbaric sport. According to Oregon Live, as part of the deal they couple must sell part of their ranch by November 2015 and forfeit $200,000 to the government. The government has recommended a sentence of probation for the couple, along with the forfeiture of $200,000.

"(CNN) -- When Michaela Cross, a U.S. student at the University of Chicago, posted a CNN iReport about the sexual harassment she says she experienced during a study abroad trip in India, the response was overwhelming. Cross' story, which is now the most-viewed iReport of all time, spawned thousands of impassioned comments and responses, many from women who live in India or who had traveled there and who wished to share their own experiences. Sexual harassment in India: 'The story you never wanted to hear' ""This is a side of India that is a reality to most young women who reside here -- or for that matter travel here,"" said Meera Vijayann, 27, from Bangalore in India. ""I wish I could take your pain away,"" said Anaka Kaundinya, 22, from Mumbai. Sexual harassment remains a pervasive problem in Indian society. Often referred to by the euphemism ""Eve-teasing,"" a 2011 survey supported by UN Women found 95% of females in New Delhi said they felt unsafe in public places. Earlier this year the country introduced stricter anti-rape laws following the fatal gang rape of a young woman in New Delhi, but gender inequality remains embedded within Indian society. As reports of another gang rape emerged in the Indian city of Mumbai on Friday, the issue remains as pertinent as ever. While Cross has garnered attention for speaking up about her experience, she's not alone. Four women with connections to India shared their own experiences, whether they felt it fair to single out India on the issue, and how best to tackle the problem. Please note that CNN cannot independently verify the incidents described below. Shwetha Kalyanasundara, 27, business development professional from Chennai. When I read Cross' article I was ashamed of my country (for the first time). But I realized that I cannot sit in my comfortable space and watch people tear my country down. Almost every woman who grows up in India has been subjected to some kind of sexual innuendos... but for every man who cannot control his libido and gives in to his over-crazed sexual drive, I can assure you that there will be 10 men who will fight for you and your dignity. Keeping chivalry alive: Men respond to India rape crisis. In Sanskrit, we say ""Matha, Pitha, Guru, Deivam"" (translated: Mother, Father, Teacher, God). The meaning of this adage is the greatest truth and is the order in which we offer reverence. This is the basic tenet in existence from time immemorial, and every man has been taught to place the womankind even above God. Indian men know to treat their women with respect. And I cannot tolerate your generalization that Indian men are bad. You cannot blame the entire male population for the actions of few. In all the countries I have been to, I have been subjected to roving eyes and sexual overtures from men. I have been leered and heckled by cab drivers and pedestrians alike. Even a middle-aged woman is not spared. Let's not be too dramatic here and accept that sexual crimes against women are a problem the world over. Shaheen Madraswala, 22, student in U.S., grew up in Mumbai. Born and raised in India, I moved to the USA three years ago to pursue my undergraduate education. Like Cross, I studied abroad in the fall of 2012. My chosen destination was Paris. Upon my return, I told family in India and friends from around the world exactly what they expected to hear.

"(CNN) -- Martin Skrtel's early own goal gave Fulham a historic first win at Anfield on Tuesday and left Liverpool in danger of finishing outside the top eight in the English top flight for the first time since 1954. With Saturday's FA Cup final against Chelsea in mind, Reds manager Kenny Dalglish rested a host of first-choice players, including Luis Suarez, Steven Gerrard and goalkeeper Pepe Reina. The home side made the worst possible start when Skrtel headed in former Liverpool defender John Arne Riise's cross, and couldn't recover against a Fulham team that had won only three previous away games this season. The London club moved level on points with eighth-placed Liverpool, while Everton edged closer to finishing above their Merseyside rivals for the first time in seven years with a 1-1 draw at Stoke. An own goal by Stoke striker Peter Crouch -- the 1,000th goal of this Premier League season -- gave Everton the lead after 44 minutes before fellow forward Cameron Jerome came off the bench to snatch a point in the 69th minute. Everton lost to Liverpool in the FA Cup semifinals, but the draw left David Moyes' side three points above the Reds with two league games to play. Liverpool were booed off by their home fans, having won three of the last 13 league games and only five times at home in the Premier League all season.

Presidents, astronauts, Supreme Court justices and other notable Americans also have been laid to rest at Arlington.

""We have heroes here from every war that the United States has fought in from the Revolutionary War on."" The initial property belonged to George Washington's extended family and then to Robert E. Lee, who left it at the start of the Civil War. Federal troops used it as an encampment, and the federal government purchased 200 acres in 1864 and established a cemetery.

"More than 100 corpses, many of them children, have been found washed up in a shallow tributary of the River Ganges. Officials do not suspect a crime, and instead believe the dead were given water burials. It is Indian custom not to cremate unwed girls, and many poor people cannot afford cremation. But their discovery has sparked renewed concerns about the health of the Ganges, a sacred river where millions of Hindus cremate their dead. Grim find: Some of the more than 100 bodies found washed up in a tributary to the River Ganges, who are believed to be people whose families could not afford to cremate them or else girls given water burials. Macabre: Bodies are seen floating in Ganges river near Pariyar. Officials do not suspect a crime, but instead believe the dead were given water burials. The 102 bodies were found floating near the village of Pariyar, in Uttar Pradesh, India's most-populous state. They were too badly decomposed for post-mortem examinations or identification, officials said. DNA testing is being done to determine where the bodies might have come from. 'Once we will complete all the legal formalities, these bodies will be buried to avoid spread of diseases,' Sub-Divisional Magistrate Saryua Shukla said. Television footage showed dogs and birds feeding on the bloated and decaying bodies floating in the stream, whose waters are thought to have receded recently. Police inspector general Satish Ganesh said they were probably given river burials upstream at a cremation area known as Pariyar Ghat before becoming stranded in shallow water. Millions of Hindus practice open-air cremation, with the ashes of loves ones scattered in the revered but heavily polluted Ganges. Their discovery has sparked renewed concerns about the health of the Ganges, a sacred river where millions of Hindus cremate their dead. Scavenger dogs and crows gather around dead human bodies that are floating in Ganges river. But poor families who cannot afford enough wood and other materials for the burning ceremony sometimes place the bodies in the water, while others are not cremated entirely. While it is illegal to dispose of the dead in rivers, some practicing Hindus also believe that giving an unwed girl a water burial will ensure she is born again into the family. The bodies of some holy men are also placed in the river instead of being cremated, in accordance with tradition. The Hindu nationalist government of Narendra Modi has vowed to clean up the Ganges. But the discovery of so many bodies in one place has intensified environmental and health concerns. Hindus bathe in the Ganges as an act of ritual purification, but the 1,600-mile river flowing from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal is full of sewage and industrial waste and increasingly suffers from water shortages.

The collection was launched with a stellar party at the new Burberry flagship at 121 Regent Street - 44,000sq ft of prime fashion real estate that has a hydraulic stage and concert-quality sound system.

Musician Roo Panes, who composed the track for the autumn/winter campaign, again shot by Testino, was also there in his Burberry best. 'The Britain is the embodiment of our rich, British heritage and all our inspirations,' Christopher Bailey said of the timepiece collection. 'It is a very personal project that we have been working on for a long time – The Britain is this powerful balance of modernity and tradition, mixing strong attitude and innovative design with craftsmanship and timeless quality.'

"Former England manager Steve McClaren has praised Roy Hodgson for the way he handled the 'nightmare' situation following Raheem Sterling's omission from the Estonia qualifier. Liverpool winger Sterling sparked controversy when he asked to sit out England's Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday because of fatigue and the Derby manager admitted some of his players were 'tired' when they reported for international duty this week. Derby manager and former England boss Steve McLaren has experienced demands of both club and country. But McClaren, who had a 16-month spell in charge of the Three Lions from 2006 to 2007, expressed sympathy for England boss Hodgson on Thursday as he attempts to deal with the latest club versus country debate. He said: 'I think Roy's handled the situation very well. Raheem looked as though he came on and changed the game and England got the win, so everybody's happy. 'At the end of the day once the players are in your care and you've got them and you think they're fit then you play them because you've got to win football matches - you're not bringing these players to look after them for the club.

"For years, chocolate, jewelry and flowers have been Valentine's Day staples. However, many consumers are now giving gifts that not only say I love you, but also help those in need. Recently, the concept of giving back through consuming gained traction with TOMS shoes, the company that makes the popular slip-on shoes and donates a pair to a child in need for every pair sold. TOMS seemed to open the door for other socially conscious brands, ones that make a difference through product sales. Now, many entrepreneurs are opening businesses and nonprofit organizations that produce socially conscious goods. From backpacks that provide an education to jewelry that empowers women to crocheted goods that help people rise out of poverty, here are three socially conscious companies that are trying to change the world with their products. Buy a backpack, fund an education in Tanzania. Matthew Clough traveled to Tanzania to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in 2008. ""I always had this dream of climbing each continent's highest summit. One of my buddies called me and asked if I wanted to climb Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa. It was my first opportunity to check one of those seven summits off the list,"" says Clough. Little did he know, reaching the peak would inspire him to pursue an even loftier goal. Clough realized that his success on the mountain would have been impossible without the help of the porters who carried his extra gear, prepared his meals and ultimately guided him to the summit. As Clough descended the mountain, he discovered that his porters made less than a dollar a day -- an amount he later learned was not nearly enough to put a child in Tanzania through school. After returning to the United States, Clough made it his mission to provide education opportunities for underserved communities. He started stone + cloth, a backpack company that donates part of its profits to support children's education in Tanzania. ""I decided to make backpacks to create a symbol linking my mountaineering trip with education. I kept thinking about how I used a backpack for school as a kid and wanted to create a tool for people to use to spread the word about educating those in need."" All stone + cloth backpacks are made in Los Angeles, with $10 from every backpack purchased going directly to its partner in Tanzania, the Knock Foundation. Together with the Knock Foundation, stone + cloth supports education programs, including tuition assistance, school meals, and school supplies -- the learning essentials. ""By purchasing a backpack our customers carry an education,"" says Clough. Beads of hope help women in Uganda. Kallie Dovel traveled to Uganda in the summer of 2007 to volunteer. She began working with women at an after-school program and quickly learned about the hardships they faced after years of conflict in the region. While getting to know the women, Dovel was introduced to jewelry they made from paper beads. ""They showed me this beautiful product but told me they weren't able to sell it. In Uganda [the jewelry made from paper beads] is looked down on,"" says Dovel. The women at the school taught Dovel how to make the paper beads and asked her to sell the jewelry for them in the United States. Dovel agreed to purchase a box from them and try to sell some pieces when she got back home. The jewelry sold quickly and inspired Dovel to team up with her friends Jessie Simonson, Anna Nelson, Brooke Hodges and Alli Swanson to create the company 31 Bits. In August of 2008, the five traveled to Uganda and started purchasing jewelry from six women, promising to employ them for at least two years. Dovel stayed in Uganda in order to oversee operations while Simonson, Nelson, Hodges and Swanson traveled back to the States to spread brand awareness. Through its success, 31 Bits has been able to hire more women and launch programs for its Ugandan employees that include English lessons, health education, and business development</s>",Brands that not only make a profit but make a difference are becoming more popular.

"By. Daily Mail Reporter. UPDATED:. 19:09 EST, 7 October 2011. Barack Obama is today facing accusations that his tale about a teacher told he was losing his job three times was not entirely accurate. The President claimed on Thursday to have ‘had a chance to meet a young man named Robert Baroz’ - but they have reportedly never met. He also talked about the teacher ‘receiving three pink slips because of budget cuts’ - but neglected to mention he reportedly never lost his job. Speech: President Barack Obama is facing accusation that his tale about a teacher told he was losing his job three times was not entirely accurate. ‘He’s got two decades of teaching experience,’ President Obama said in a press conference on Thursday. ‘He’s got a master’s degree. 'In the last few years, he’s received three pink slips because of budget cuts. Why wouldn’t we want to pass a bill that puts somebody like Robert back in the classroom teaching our kids?' President Barack Obama. ‘He’s got an outstanding track record of helping his students make huge gains in reading and writing. In the last few years, he’s received three pink slips because of budget cuts. ‘Why wouldn’t we want to pass a bill that puts somebody like Robert back in the classroom teaching our kids?’ The nearest they reportedly ever got to meeting was when Mr Baroz was on the front row of a jobs bill press conference at the White House last month. Teacher: Mr Baroz has received 'three pink slips' - but his job reportedly always remained because of stimulus money or the last year's congressional jobs bill. Mr Baroz only actually met with White House aides and President Obama’s education chief after the event, reported the Boston Herald. He has received ‘three pink slips’ - but his job always remained because of stimulus money or last year’s congressional jobs bill, reported the paper. Mr Baroz is now working as a ‘literacy and data coach’ at a school in Jamaica Plain, near Boston, Massachusetts, reported the Boston Herald. But he said he was happy for President Obama to use poetic licence to explain the importance of ‘investing in education and in communities’. Rose Garden: The nearest they reportedly ever got to meeting was when Mr Baroz was on the front row of a jobs bill press conference at the White House. ‘It was technically correct - yes, I. did lose my position three times within four years in the Boston Public.

Mr. Baroz added that President Obama posed a rhetorical question by talking. of people like him who are well-qualified but no working.

"FIFA ethics investigator Michael Garcia has lost his appeal against the findings which cleared Qatar and Russia to host the 2022 and 2018 World Cups. Garcia last month claimed a statement by ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert on his report into bidding for the World Cups had contained 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions' and announced he would appeal. That appeal has now been declared inadmissible by FIFA's appeals committee, who said Eckert's statement was not a legally-binding decision and therefore could not be appealed against. Ethics investigator Michael Garcia's appeal has been dismissed by FIFA. Eckert's statement said any rule breaches by the bidding countries were 'of very limited scope', adding: 'In particular, the effects of these occurrences on the bidding process as a whole were far from reaching any threshold that would require returning to the bidding process, let alone reopening it.' A FIFA statement said: 'The FIFA appeal committee, chaired by Larry Mussenden, has concluded that the appeal lodged by the chairman of the investigatory chamber, Michael J. Garcia, against the statement of the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of the independent ethics committee, Hans-Joachim Eckert, is not admissible. Michael Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert pictured together earlier this year. 'The said statement about the report on the inquiry into the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process does not constitute a decision and as such is neither legally binding nor appealable.' Meanwhile, complaints by two World Cup bid whistleblowers that their cover had been blown by Eckert's findings have also been rejected. Phaedra Almajid, who worked for the Qatar 2022 bid team before losing her job in 2010, and Bonita Mersiades, who worked for Australia's 2022 bid, complained that promises of confidentiality had been breached because his findings contained more than enough information to make them easily identifiable. Almajid said in a statement: 'The conclusion of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee dismissing my complaint against Herr Eckert for breaching my confidentiality is a transparent avoidance of a clear violation of its own rules. 'I cooperated with Mr. Garcia’s investigation for over two and a half years under a clear, unqualified promise of confidentiality. He asked me for my confidentiality and repeatedly promised me mine. I kept my promise. Herr Eckert breached that confidentiality. I did not. The Disciplinary Committee’s avoidance of this undisputable violation is emblematic of its culture of self-protection. 'The Disciplinary Committee’s assertion that I had “gone public with [my] own media activities long before the publication” of Herr Eckert’s statement is an obvious dodge. My public statements were all made long before I entered into a confidentiality agreement with Mr. Garcia. 'I made no public statements during the entire period of Mr. Garcia’s investigation.

"The Warwick Rowing Club know how to perk up a Friday afternoon. The university students have just released the 2015 version of their naked calendar and there is no shortage of bare skin in sight. As well as raising money for their rowing club, the men are also putting cash from the sales towards their charity - Sport Allies, which works to combat homophobia in sport. Scroll down for video. Warwick University Rowing Club have released their fifth naked calendar. Previous editions have been sold in 77 countries and raised £200,000. Five years ago, the rowers at Warwick University were just a middle-ranking sports club without the funding to repair their boats. Then in 2009, decided to release a naked calendar to raise some-much needed funds for repairs and new equipment. Since then it has gone on to be sold in 77 different countries and raised £200,000 for good causes. As well as the calendars, the boys now have their own range of posters, t-shirts, art prints, hoodies, and greeting cards. Laurie, a second year student at Warwick University said that they decided to start the Sport Allies charity to give something back to the people who bought the calendars in the first place. He said: 'It was really the gay market that was supporting the calendar and buying it and in turn supporting the boat club. 'Sport allies is about standing up and confronting homophobia in sport. 'It’s a chance to really change things. 'Sport doesn’t have to be a homophobic environment and shouldn’t be a homophobic environment.' Sport Allies is an outreach programme for young people challenged by bullying, homophobia or low self-esteem.

A 19-year-old Michigan girl missing since Saturday has been found stabbed to death and dumped in a river the day after her abusive ex-boyfriend was due to be sent to jail. The body of Kaley Brooks was spotted trapped beneath the ice in the river on Christmas Eve, a few days after her ex-boyfriend, Nicholas Jackson, was found dead after apparently shooting himself. Several stab wounds were found on Kaley and blood stains believed to be from her were discovered in a car belonging to Jackson. Killed: Kaley Brooks was found stabbed and trapped under ice in a Michigan river on Christmas Eve. Jackson, 18, was found dead on Sunday. Police say he had assaulted Kaley in October, and had been due to be sentenced to prison on Monday. According to WILX10, after the aggravated assault in October he had been ordered to stay away from Kaley, who had suffered extensive injuries. The college student was last seen on Saturday afternoon when Jackson picked her up from the McDonald's drive-thru where she worked. Her mom had dropped her off at 3pm and Kaley, who hadn't been due to start her shift until 5pm, had told her manager she had errands to run before work. Police believed she had been a victim of foul play from the moment she was reported as missing, MLive reported. Troubled: Kaley with Jackson, who had been due to start a prison sentence after assaulting her in October. Evidence: Blood found on the backseat of Jackson's car is believed to have come from Kaley. Jackson was believed to have been involved but police have said the investigation is still open. Her body was found after a relative spotted one of her shoes on the river bank on Tuesday, just over a mile from Jackson's home. 'The development would be a sad one anytime of the year. Especially around Christmas time,' director Mike Jester said. The victim's mother, Heather Brooks, told MLive before Kaley was found: 'She is just so loving and caring and sensitive to everyoneâ€TMs needs.' Ms Brooks, and Kaley's stepfather Curt.

"By. Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline. Running a marathon is a momentous effort for most people - a once-in-a-lifetime event to tick off the bucket list. But for Rob Young, 31, from Richmond, south London, it's a daily occurrence. He gets up at 2.45am every morning to run a whole marathon course around Richmond Park before he starts his working day as the manager of a specialist car parts company. What makes this all the more impressive is that Rob has had to overcome an incredibly abusive childhood with a father who beat him regularly, followed by a period in care homes, in order to get to this place. Rob Young taking part in one of his 367 marathons planned for this year. Until the age of six, Rob lived in Yorkshire with his mother and sister under his father's reign of terror - not even the family dog was safe from the daily violent outbursts, which saw his sister sexually abused and him thrown down stairs in a suitcase. He said: 'As a young child I was witness to some terrible things, which most people would find hard to imagine or understand. 'I was beaten pretty much every day, with anything that easily came to my father's hand. 'It could be a slipper, a stick or a plank of wood, today I still have quite a number of scars on my body from these beatings. 'Sometimes my father would zip me into a suitcase and push me down the stairs, this was one of the milder things I had to endure, though. 'The worst thing was being dangled over the banister at the top of the stairs by one leg - he used to tell me that if I made any noise at all or if I cried he would drop me.' The breaking point came one evening when Rob was six years old - his father returned home and started a bout of violence that ended with Rob being hung with a rope. He said: 'He tied a rope around my neck from which he hung me on an old-fashioned coat hanger near the front door. Happily ever after: Rob Young now lives in Richmond, south London, with his fiancée Joanna Hanasz, 26, and son Alexander-Lui Julian Young, 21 months. 'I remember the feeling of having no air to breathe and I struggled as my father held my legs, it became very scary until he decided to let me down.' Rob's mother decided that enough was enough and fled the family home with her two children in tow. Sadly, she was unable to care for them and while Rob's sister was sent to live with an aunt, he was put in a care home. What followed was an incredibly tough few years, as he struggled to make his voice heard among hundreds of other lost children while being passed from care home to care home. Rob said: 'That was very difficult, because I was lumped in there with a lot of other children, very troubled children who were often a lot older than me, who bullied each other and who are from very disruptive backgrounds. 'The people who work in these places often don’t know how to cope and many also just see it as a job. 'The reason that a lot of these children behave the way they do is because the only way to get attention is by acting up - by getting into trouble - that’s the only way anyone will ever notice you. Rob Young runs a marathon every day and takes part in group marathons most weekends. 'I was like that too for a while, but then I remember the moment that I switched – I must have been about eight or nine years old and someone said to me: ""You’re going to turn out</s>","Rob Young, 31, gets up at 2.45am every day to run a marathon before work.

"Washington (CNN) -- The FBI attained ""actionable intelligence"" from bombing suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab in the first hours after his arrest on Christmas Day, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday. ""AbdulMutallab spent a number of hours with FBI investigators in which we gleaned useable, actionable intelligence,"" Gibbs told reporters. According to authorities, Nigerian-born AbdulMutallab tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as a flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, made its final approach to Detroit, Michigan, December 25. The device failed to fully detonate, instead setting off a fire at the man's seat. Gibbs declined to elaborate on the nature of the intelligence. AbdulMutallab, 23, has been tied to the Yemen-based group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In a statement to reporters after meeting with his national security team, President Obama said U.S. officials had enough information in their possession before the failed bombing attack to have prevented the suspect from getting on the plane, but had been unable to ""connect the dots."" Obama said he could accept the imperfect nature of intelligence work, ""but it is increasingly clear that intelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged,"" he said, adding: ""That's not acceptable, and I will not tolerate it."" ""Time and again we've learned that quickly piecing together information and taking swift action is critical to staying one step ahead of a nimble adversary,"" Obama said. ""So we have to do better, and we will do better, and we have to do it quickly. American lives are on the line."" In one step, senior State Department officials told CNN on Tuesday that new criteria for information collected on possible terrorists would make it easier to ban them from U.S.-bound flights. Speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the material, the officials said the United States has lowered the threshold for information considered important enough to put suspicious individuals on a no-fly list or revoke their visas. If the new criteria had been in place before Christmas, AbdulMutallab would have been added to the no-fly list, the officials said. AbdulMutallab is being held at the Federal Correctional Institution in Milan, Michigan, where he's still being treated for the burn injuries he received in the failed bombing. He faces charges of attempting to destroy an aircraft, and will face his first court hearings Friday. The suspect apparently arrived in Amsterdam already carrying the explosives he planned to use, Dutch prosecutors said Tuesday. ""The suspect traveled through Ghana before he arrived via Lagos [Nigeria] at Schiphol,"" prosecutors said, referring to the airport where AbdulMutallab boarded the flight to Detroit. ""So far, it seems he already had the explosives with him before he landed at Schiphol."" Also Tuesday, British officials announced that London's Heathrow Airport will introduce more body scanners within weeks, and that all British airports must have equipment to detect explosives by the end of the year. British Home Secretary Alan Johnson said the British government had no evidence AbdulMutallab had been planning an attack. Johnson added that British authorities were directing airports to carry out more random searches of passengers because metal detectors cannot spot explosives without metal parts. Last week, Obama blamed human error and security lapses for the failure by officials to act on information that AbdulMutallab was a possible terrorist threat. He had a valid multiple-entry U.S. visa. His father, a leading banker in Nigeria, had warned U.S. authorities before the attack that his son might be involved with Islamic extremists, but the information failed to prompt a response such as canceling the visa.

She is due to attend Spelman College in Atlanta in the fall. The schoolgirl's mother, Reenita Shephard, said that although the family of five sometimes had an apartment to live in, it was only ever for a short time. 'Ended up back in another shelter. because I got laid off from my job maybe about four or five times,. she said. The family regularly had to move apartments, or live in shelters, hotels or the family car, while they still had one. 'My mom, whenever we're in that situation, she always finds. a way out of it. So I would just tell myself, tomorrow it will not be. like this,' Chelesa said. Ms Shephard refused to let their precarious home situation ruin her children's chances, adding: 'I read to them a lot. Everything was a learning experience.' Proud: Reenita Shephard encourages Chelesa and her siblings to read and work hard. Head start: Chelesa did so well academically that she will start as a junior when she goes to Spelman. Her parenting skills paid off.

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israeli airstrikes on Gaza continued for a fifth day Wednesday, as the Jewish state's defense minister mulled a truce proposal to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. A column of Israeli armored vehicles is deployed in a farmer's field Tuesday near the Gaza border. The air assault overnight into Wednesday struck the office of Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and the Hamas Interior Ministry, among other targets, the Israeli Defense Forces told CNN. The airstrikes followed a mission Tuesday that leveled at least three buildings in a Hamas government compound. The Israeli air force also blasted away at a series of tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt through the Rafah crossing. Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak was considering the truce proposal -- originally raised by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner -- and would bring it to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for consideration, a Defense Ministry official said Tuesday. However, Israeli Defense Forces denied earlier media reports saying it would advise Olmert to adopt a two-day truce. Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz had reported ""the goal of the temporary calm would be to see if Hamas can abide by the truce and cease firing rockets at Israel."" Kouchner called Olmert Tuesday afternoon about the proposal, French Foreign Ministry sources said. France, which holds the rotating European Union presidency until Thursday, had brought together foreign ministers in Paris to address the situation in Gaza and in southern Israel. French President Nicolas Sarkozy's office said Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni will meet Sarkozy in Paris on Thursday. The Israeli military says it was targeting only Hamas militants, blaming them for rocket fire into southern Israel. Hamas has vowed to defend Gaza in the face of what it calls continued Israeli aggression. Each side blames the other for violating an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire, which formally expired December 19 but had been weakening for months. Learn more about Gaza's political history ». Meanwhile, U.S. President George W. Bush called Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to discuss a ""sustainable cease-fire,"" White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe told reporters in Crawford, Texas. And the Middle East quartet -- comprised of the United States, the United Nations, Russia and the European Union -- conferred on a conference call about the situation. However, Gaza is controlled by Hamas -- considered a terrorist group by Israel and the United States. Neither will negotiate with Hamas leadership, which seeks an Islamic fundamentalist Palestinian state. A Hamas spokesman said he didn't consider a temporary truce feasible now. ""There is nowhere to talk about just the 48-hours cease-fire,"" Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan told CNN's ""Situation Room"" on Tuesday. ""We have to talk about an end for this attack, Israeli attacks against the Palestinians and opening all of the borders for the Palestinians to have aid -- either medical aid or another other kind of support -- and then we can talk about the politics."" The United Nations has called for both sides to end the violence, and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has roundly condemned both sides: Hamas for the rocket fire and Israel for its ""excessive use of force"" in retaliating. Despite the rumblings on a potential truce, Olmert warned earlier Tuesday the airstrikes were only the beginning of a wider military operation, telling Peres, ""We are currently at the first stage of the operation,"" Israeli government officials said.

"One of the Real Housewives of Miami and her plastic-surgeon husband recently won the right to tear down their historic 1920s mansion, and they spared no time getting on with the demolition. Photos show an excavator razing the beatuiful white spanish-style estate on Tuesday, after years of legal battles with local preservationists. Leonard Hochstein is a local pastic surgeon who calls himself the 'Boob God' and his stay-at-home wife Lisa, 31, has starred on the Real Housewives since its second season in 2012. Scroll down for video. Bring out the excavator: Leonard and Lisa Hochstein began demolition on their 1925 Miami Beach mansion today after winning a battle against preservationists who wanted to give it historical status. Working woman: Real Housewife Lisa Hochstein got behind the excavator to do some of the demolition herself. Before: Lisa Hochstein stars on reality show The Real Housewives of Miami. Her husband Leonard is a plastic surgeon who calls himself the 'Boob God' Tearing it down in style: Preservationists in Miami Beach had been fighting the Hochsteins to keep the old building. After demolition started today, Lisa sent off a victorious tweet. Lisa poses on the excavator brought in to demolish her 1920s estate. Photo shoot: The real housewife posed for a few shots on demolition day. Lisa marked the momentous occasion by sending out a victorious tweet to her 109,000 followers on Twitter, writing: 'I just took the first major chunk out of our star island home in my High heels, I can do anything in heels lol #demolision #bubbye' The Hochsteins purchased the 1925 home as a forecloser in late 2012, paying less than $8million for the property. It was built by Walter deGarmo, Florida's first registered architect. TV star: Lisa Hochstein (left) has been on the Real Housewives of Miami since the second season in 2012. Stay at home: Lisa does not work. Above, the couple at a restaurant opening in Miami on March 15. In its place, the Hochsteins will be rebuilding a 20,000-square-foot mega-mansion complete with six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a home theater, a game room, a wine cellar, five-car garage and a guest house. When local preservationsts found out about the plan, they initially tried to block it by petitioning that the home be historically designated. The move by the Miami Preservation League was eventually thrown out and now the Hochsteins are allowed to start construction on their new home. Falling apart: The Hochsteins show off some of the damaged parts of the decaying home. Coming soon: The 1925s home will be replaced with a 20,000-square foot mansion. Buh-bye! The couple posing outside the home before demolition. Tear-downs have been on the rise in Miami Beach with 53 demolition applications filed between 2012 and 2013. That's more than the seven years combined when there were just 21 applications total. Some homeowners are tearing down their beach-front homes because they lie below the federal flood plain, meaning they have to pay extremely high insurance rates. Another reason is that the land value is often worth much more than the homes itself. For example, the Hochstein's home was valued at $1.2million while the land it lays on is $8.3million. In an interview with the Miami Herald in December 2012, Leanard Hochstein explained why he was tearing down the historic home to make way for something new.

'He went underground to hibernate and we didn't know whereabouts in the garden he had gone too,' said property developer Mr Strand, 49. 'When he came back up he was in a bad way - his front legs had been gnawed at by rats. 'After taking advice we rushed him to the vets and he had to have his lower front legs amputated.

"By. Neil Sears and Emily Davies. PUBLISHED:. 18:39 EST, 21 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 04:53 EST, 22 July 2013. Good neighbours? Holly Willoughby and her husband Daniel Baldwin reacted angrily to claims they kept neighbours up with a house party. Her good girl image was somewhat diminished after she wore a very revealing black dress on the final of The Voice last month, prompting 139 complaints to the BBC. So an ugly neighbourly dispute is the last thing that TV presenter Holly Willoughby will have wanted – not least because she has been accused of ‘keeping the whole neighbourhood up last night with drunken behaviour’. The accusation was made in an anonymous letter delivered to the £3million home she shares with her TV executive husband Daniel Baldwin and their two young children. Mr Baldwin, 37, reacted angrily to the letter by emailing 50 neighbours, many of whom the couple have never met, seeking help in tracking down the letter-writer. He denies creating any such noise, saying he and Miss Willoughby were watching Nashville – a US drama set in the world of country music – and that they want ‘an explanation’ from their critic. And to assist their hunt, Mr Baldwin attached two images of the woman who delivered the letter, obtained from the CCTV cameras bristling from his luxury home. Now one furious neighbour has accused the pair of hypocrisy, saying that the couple have unleashed ‘utter building chaos’ on the area over the last year. David Moss, 55, said: ‘We have been shocked by this vicious intrusive email, in which they make themselves out to be good neighbours, when we have had enormous trucks blocking the pavement six days a week.’ The row has disrupted the usual calm in the well-heeled area of south-west London, where Miss Willoughby and her husband bought their house 18 months ago. Since then they have lavished hundreds of thousands more on the house, which already boasts an impressive garden and balconies overlooking the Thames. They have made a series of planning applications, including bids to build a large extension, a garage complete with ‘staff accommodation’, and a large swimming pool. It seems the neighbours have tolerated the work – but somebody must have snapped on Saturday morning, when the letter was delivered. The streets around Ms Willoughby's home: One. furious neighbour has accused the pair of hypocrisy, saying that the. couple have unleashed 'utter building chaos' on the area over the past. year. In the afternoon, Mr Baldwin sent out his email, headed, ‘Your help – our neighbourhood’. It read: ‘Dear Neighbours, this morning this lady left a letter on my doorstep. The letter was extremely rude and overly aggressive (I’ll save you from the gory details). Mystery critic: CCTV footage of the mystery woman who delivered the letter to Ms Willoughby's £3million home sent out by her husband. ‘It wrongly accused us of “keeping the whole neighbourhood up last night with drunken behaviour”. ‘In fact the whole house was in bed by 10.30pm – after two episodes of Nashville (please don’t judge me on this!). ‘The letter had no name or house number so I’d very much like to explain this to the lady on the picture and I’d like an explanation from her on the letter’s contents. ‘Her photo, from our CCTV footage is attached. Any help clearing this up would be hugely appreciated. ‘I’d like to think that we live in a neighbourhood where we can freely knock on our neighbours doors and have a civilised chat about any concerns/worries/issues.’ Mr Moss, who works in the</s>","Accusation made in anonymous letter to presenter's £3million home.

"Civil rights activists have demanded that a Django Unchained actress apologize for accusing police of singling her out because of her race. Daniele Watts hit out at the Los Angeles Polcie Department, who she claimed pulled her up and arrested her for kissing her boyfriend in a car parked on the street last week. However, police maintain that there was no racial element to the incident, and that their officer was responding to reports of a couple having sex in public - leading to a backlash from civil rights experts, who accuse Watts of 'crying wolf' to cover her own back. Confrontation: Daniele Watts,left, is seen with two LAPD officers. She claims she was targeted due to race. 'Crying wolf': Watts, pictured with boyfriend Brian Lucas, has come under fire from civil rights activists. An audio recording, obtained by MailOnline, reveals a hysterical Watts confronting police in a heated exchange during which she uses the N-word, and claims legal expertise from her experience playing a cop on TV. The fallout from the incident led to prominent civil rights activists decrying Watts in public and saying that she was harming their cause. Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable President Earl Ofari Hutchinson, Project Islamic Hope President Najee Ali and others released a statement this morning in the Inglewood area of LA. Silver screen: Watts is pictured above as Coco, a house servant she played in the Tarantino film. Hutchinson said: 'There was provable cause for the detention. You must have your facts. You can't rush to judgment. If you do that, you have no credibility.' According to NBC, he added: 'It's like crying wolf - after a while, it has no meaning.' Ali also spoke against her, CBS reported. He said: 'She should be embarrassed. She's the one that told the lie. She came and stated she's a victim of racial profiling. We found out later on based on new information that she wasn't,' The newly-unearthed audio file came shortly after still images showed Watts straddling her boyfriend Brian James Lucas in a car. Recordings captured the moment that police slapped handcuffs on Miss Watts after she walked away from an officer who asked to see her identification. Watts and the officers involved disputed whether her ID card was necessary, followed by Watts bringing her acting experience into the fray. 'I played a copy on TV!' Daniele Watts, who has accused the LAPD of harassment, played police cadet Angela Mullen in the Showtime comedy 'Weeds' Attacks: Watts did not get an easy ride on social media, as the above tweet by radio host Larry Elder shows. In the audio recording, Miss Watts sobs after being cuffed. An officer can be heard trying to calm her down. She tells him through tears: 'You're not the one in handcuffs, you're not the one who's spent your life being called a n*****, and growing up in the South and now I get the cops called on me. 'I'm an actress at this studio! I'm in a major sitcom and I'm still being put in handcuffs because I'm making out with my boyfriend.' Sgt Jim Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, says he was offended by claims that Miss Watts was harassed because she is a black woman with a white boyfriend. Sgt Parker said he's witnessed first hand many of the department's most dramatic moments</s>","Police stopped Daniele Watts after reports of couple having sex in public.

"By. Caroline Graham. Peter Sellers's daughter has revealed how a visit to a psychic persuaded her to forgive the comedian after he apologised for excluding her from his will. When the Pink Panther and Goons star died of a heart attack in 1980, aged 54, he left the bulk of his £5.5million fortune to his fourth wife, Lynne Frederick, whom Victoria ‘loathed’ and Sellers was divorcing. Victoria, his only child with his second wife Britt Ekland, was left just £800 – with a further £10,000 for her education. Victoria with her father in Monte Carol in 1968. When the Pink Panther and Goons star died of a heart attack in 1980, aged 54, he left Victoria, his only child just £800. The actor’s estate, valued at £20million today, ended up going to Frederick’s young daughter, Cassie Unger, the product of a later marriage to Californian heart doctor Barry Unger, after her mother drank herself to death in 1994. It was only after Victoria, 49, visited a psychic last November that she came to terms with her father’s decision. ‘What happened was so profound I couldn’t ignore it,’ she said. ‘The guy didn’t know who I was. I went there with a folder, which I kept closed, which had a picture of me, Dad, my Swedish grandma and a couple of letters from my father written on his favourite Gucci notepaper. Peter Sellers pictured with fourth wife Lynn Frederick in 1978. He left the bulk of his £5.5million fortune to his fourth wife, Lynne Frederick, whom Victoria 'loathed' Peter Sellers married Britt Ekland in February 1964. Victoria, his only child with Britt, was born in January 1965. A scene from the film 'The Pink Panther' (1963) starring Peter Sellers. ‘The medium said my father wanted to apologise. He said Dad was proud of me for surviving what I’d been through and that none of it had been meant to happen, that he was sorry. ‘People might think I’m nuts but it was what I needed to hear. After all these years it was time to let go of the anger. I sobbed my heart out. ‘I went home and took out photographs of him that I’d kept hidden away for years. I looked up and said, “It’s OK Dad, we’re good.” ’ Victoria rents a room in West Hollywood and works at a restaurant. After a lifelong battle with alcohol and drug addiction, she has been clean for three years. She had two half-siblings, Sarah and Michael, from her father’s first marriage to actress Anne Howe. Sarah shuns the limelight, running a teddy bear shop in London, while Michael died in 2006, aged 52. Victoria. said: ‘They missed out on the legacy, too. Dad’s will didn’t just hurt. me, it hurt the whole family. We never contested it because under. British law you can only contest a will if you are left nothing. We were. left a paltry amount.’ Victoria would like to come to an agreement with Unger, who controls the Sellers fortune, including the rights to his name. She. said: ‘Cassie can keep all Dad’s millions. All I want is the right to. use my father’s name. It belongs to us, his family. And there are home. movies of me and Dad I’ve never seen. I’ve given up on wanting any. money. But I’d love to see those movies.’ Victoria Sellers has come to terms with being virtually ignored in her father's will.</s> <pad> <pad>","The Goons and Pink Panther star died of a heart attack in July 1980, aged 54.

"By. Nina Golgowski. Correction officials have unmasked a once-respected owner of a California drug rehab center as a parolee convicted of murder who eluded capture under a fake identity for more than three decades. Richard Bradford had spent the last 32 years living a double life under the name of James Edward Heard while owning several properties in the Pasadena area including an upscale rehab facility endorsed by the mayor, according to authorities. Bradford was sentenced to life for first-degree murder in 1971, was paroled in 1978, but skipped out on his parole supervision in 1980, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement on Wednesday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Found: Richard Bradford, seen outside his Pasadena drug treatment center, had been living for decades under the false name of James Edward Heard after skipping out on his parole supervision in 1980. Agents arrested Bradford this week, more than 32 years after he had disappeared, the statement said. A false birth certificate with Heard's name was created in Alameda County in 1977, and a Social Security card was issued to him in 1978, both while he was still in prison, officials said. By the early 1980s Bradford began using the new name, and the name Richard Bradford disappeared on paper by 1992. A parole apprehension team began an investigation into his disappearance in 2010, and about a year later learned he might be the same person as Heard. Bradford's prison fingerprints were found to be a match with Heard's from the Department of Motor Vehicles. Bradford's attorney contacted corrections officials at about the same time saying he knew he was being sought and would like some time to turn himself in, but he never did. New life: Bradford, who was sentenced to life for murder, ran the Eaton Canyon Treatment Center, an upscale rehab facility endorsed by the mayor, seen here. It took investigators two years to. find Bradford, who had been keeping a low profile in the Pasadena area,. with his businesses controlled by a trust and his credit cards and. vehicles in the name of his treatment center, the Eaton Canyon Treatment Center. On Sunday while conducting surveillance, agents saw Bradford and his wife leave their home and followed them to the Home Depot just east of Pasadena in Monrovia, where they arrested Bradford and his wife. She was taken into custody for being a felon in possession of pepper spray. Her name was not released. Speaking to KCAL from inside the treatment center his wife called the charges against her husband fictitious. Method: After obtaining a fake birth certificate and social security number under his new name Bradford additionally put his credit cards and vehicles in the name of his treatment center as well, pictured. A search of the house turned up evidence for both of Bradford's names, the statement said. Corrections officials did not provide the name of Bradford's attorney, and no other contact information to seek comment from a lawyer or family member could be found. One of Bradford’s neighbors expressed her shock of his true identity calling it 'horrifying' while describing him as a generally angry man.

"(CNN) -- In this space, Michele Flournoy, former undersecretary of defense under President Barack Obama, and some of her colleagues attacked a recent Mitt Romney opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. In their piece, entitled ""Romney's empty foreign policy agenda,"" they hurl all sorts of tired accusations at the Republican nominee. They even recycle a trope used by Democrats against Ronald Reagan and other successful Republican presidents, that Romney employs ""cowboy rhetoric."" Yet even as they condemn the Republican nominee for wrapping himself in ""platitudes and falsehoods,"" they offer a remarkable demonstration of some of the serious problems afflicting Obama's stewardship of America's role in the world. Let us scrutinize some of their points. Opinion: Romney's empty foreign policy agenda. On Iran, they assert that there are ""zero actual policy differences"" between Obama and Romney, citing the president's policy of sanctions. But what they neglect to say is that Obama resisted imposing the kind of new, crippling sanctions that are necessary to stop Iranian nuclear efforts for much of his presidency. Today, Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than ever before. What they also conveniently forget is that Obama, saying he did not want to ""be seen as meddling,"" at first issued no more than cursory objections during the Iranian spring of 2009, when dissidents took to the streets of Tehran and other cities to protest a stolen election. A President Romney would never abandon our basic principles of supporting freedom and democracy in this way. Flournoy and company point proudly to the fact that Osama bin Laden is dead ""on the president's watch."" They are right to be proud of this, as are all Americans. But when they say that ""more al Qaeda senior leaders have been taken off the battlefield than at any time since 9/11,"" they run the danger of hubris. And hubris has been one of the defining characteristics of the president's foreign policy. Alas, we saw a tragic demonstration of the consequences of hubris just this past September 11, when four Americans -- including our ambassador -- were murdered in a terrorist attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Perhaps believing its own rhetoric about the decimation of al Qaeda, the Obama administration let down its guard about the significant striking power of al Qaeda's remnants, affiliated and otherwise. Certainly, the inadequate protection given to our diplomatic personnel on September 11 -- the anniversary of the terrible attack -- is a spectacular piece of evidence that their judgment was skewed. Even worse, after the attack on Benghazi, the Obama administration appeared to be so desperate to believe that al Qaeda was not responsible that it pinned the entire episode on the spontaneous rage of a crowd provoked by an obscure video on the Internet. It clung to this version past the point of decency. But it was false. American intelligence agencies have made it clear that our citizens were killed in a terrorist attack launched by an al Qaeda affiliate. Flournoy's assertion that Obama ""has effectively managed the tumult of the Arab Spring"" would be laughable if the consequences of his lack of effective management were not so tragic.

The stylish Swiss took just 53 minutes to win in straight sets 6-2 6-2 and ease into Sunday's final with Milos Raonic. The big-serving Canadian defeated Kei Nishikori 7-6 6-7 7-6 in the day's other semi-final. If Federer triumphs Sunday, he will chalk up his 83rd career title and become only the third man to record 1,000 ATP Tour wins after Ivan Lendl and Jimmy Connors. ""I was able to play straightforward tennis... just really aggressive,"" said Federer in comments carried by the ATP Tour website. ""Against a really good player, it's a great result."" Federer hinted that the quickfire nature of the victory could give him the edge against Raonic Sunday. "" (I'm) happy I didn't waste much energy like this,"" he said. ""I'm fresh for the finals. I've probably got a slight advantage over Milos in that regard."" Referring to the 1,000 victory milestone on court immediately after the match, Federer added that it will be a proud moment when it happens. ""I hope it's going to happen in Australia, lets put it that way,"" he said. ""Either tomorrow or next week at the Aussie Open,"" which begins in Melbourne on January 19.

"Washington (CNN) -- A former Los Alamos National Laboratory nuclear scientist and his wife were indicted on charges of trying to provide nuclear secrets to Venezuela, but U.S. officials stressed the Venezuelan government knew nothing about the plans. The officials said they have no information from the undercover operation that Hugo Chavez's government has any plans to try to build a nuclear weapon. Pedro Mascheroni, 75, and Roxby Mascheroni, 67, are U.S. citizens who worked as contractors at Los Alamos in New Mexico, officials said Friday. In 2008, Mascheroni, who had left the laboratory years earlier, had a series of conversations with an undercover FBI agent posing as an official of the Caracas government, according to the indictment. ""Mascheroni allegedly said he could help Venezuela develop a nuclear bomb within 10 years and that under his program Venezuela would use a secret underground nuclear reactor to produce and enrich plutonium and an open, above-ground reactor to produce nuclear energy,"" the Justice Department said.

"Within days of Cangrande’s death in the 14th century, rumours began circulating that the Italian ruler had been deliberately poisoned. And now toxicological tests carried out on the exhumed body of the Lord of Verona claim to have confirmed these historical reports. Fatal concentrations of digitoxin from the foxglove plant was found in the liver and faeces of the body, and experts believe the most likely explanation was that he was fed the flower surreptitiously. Researchers from the University of Pisa studied the toxicology of Cangrande's mummified remains. The body was exhumed and unwrapped (left to right) in 2004. During the recent analysis, experts found presence of pollen grains from the poisonous flower foxglove, and toxic levels of digitoxin in liver and faecal samples. The mummy of Can Francesco della Scala, or Cangrande I, was exhumed from its tomb in the church of Santa Maria Antica in Verona in 2004. It was submitted to a multidisciplinary study, that included archaeological, palaeopathological - the study of ancient diseases - palynological – the study of pollens - toxicological and historical tests. In the tomb, researchers discovered a well-preserved mummified body (pictured), wrapped in silk. He was on his back with his arms folded. Inside the mummy, researchers discovered a well-preserved body, wrapped in silk. Cangrande was lying on his back with his arms folded across his chest. The 5ft 7in (1.7 metre) mummy was initially studied using a CT scanner, which identified regurgitated food in the throat, as well as signs of sinusitis. Signs of mild arthritis were additionally found in his elbows and hips, along with evidence of cirrhosis and tuberculosis. Following an abdominal CT scan, the researchers spotted evidence of faeces in the rectum. Gino Fornaciaria from the University of Pisa carried out the autopsy with sample collection of tissues and a histological study. The radiological study was performed at the University Hospital of Verona under the supervision of Professor Giuseppe Gortenuti. The toxicological study was carried out at the University of Verona under the supervision of Professor Franco Tagliaro. And the palynological study was performed at a private laboratory by Dr Silvia Marvelli. Preliminary analysis found presence of pollen grains from the foxglove flower, known as Digitalis, and traces of camomile and black mulberry. Toxicological analysis revealed toxic concentrations of digoxin and digitoxin, from Digitalis, in the liver and faecal samples. Cangrande della Scala was exhumed from its tomb in the church of Santa Maria Antica in Verona (marked). His body was submitted to a multidisciplinary study, that included archaeological, palaeopathological - the study of ancient diseases - palynological – the study of pollens - and toxicological tests.

"By. Victoria Woollaston. It’s taken almost half a century to discover what creature made these tiny fossilised footprints, but researchers are now sure they were made by an ancient spider. The prints were uncovered during the 1960s in Northern Arizona by palaeontologist Raymond Alf. Following years of experiments and studies, experts now claim the prints were made by a 2.5-inch long tarantula-sized arachnid, and date back approximately 260 million years. The footprints, pictured, were uncovered in Arizona in 1968. They are on display at the Raymond M Alf Museum of Paleontology in California and experts believe the tracks date back 260 million years. They would have been made by a tarantula-sized creature said to have been approximately 2.5-inches long. In January, researchers from Kansas. discovered a rare spider fossil in China, after uncovering a similar. fossil in the same region three years earlier. The. original female fossil, found in the Daohugou beds of Inner Mongolia in. 2011, was so well preserved experts claimed it was part of the Nephila. species. But the recent discovery of a similar-sized male fossil cast serious doubt over. this theory because its relative size didn’t fit the Nephila mould. In. fact, the researchers were so baffled by the differences, they proposed. a new genus called Mongolarachne, to describe the creature. It. is thought the arachnids roamed the east 165 million years ago – almost a. millennia after the spider who left the footprints in Arizona. The fossils are on display in the Hall of Footprints at the Raymond M Alf Museum of Palaeontology, named after the palaeontologist who made the discovery. Alf discovered the imprints in rock during an expedition to the deserts of Arizona in 1968, which include the Painted Desert and parts of the Mojave Desert. According to the museum, the moisture in the sand preserved the prints and as the sand dried in the sun, these prints became permanent. This sand eventually hardened into rock. After retrieving the fossils, Alf carried out a number of experiments which involved walking spiders and scorpions over inkpads and paper to mimic the shape and size of the prints. These tests were repeated by geologist Christa Sadler in 1993 and both experiments concluded the prints were made by a tarantula-sized spider.

Expert Anthony Martin told Wired the prints reveal the legs on each side of the creature would have have been moving at different times, which is ‘very typical pattern with terrestrial arthropods.’ Researchers haven't determined the exact type of spider which left the prints, but it's believed to have been similar to modern-day tarantulas found in northern Arizona, stock image pictured. Alf museum curator Andrew Farke added the arachnid was likely to have been 2.5-inches in length, and research suggests the fossils are 260 million-years-old.

"By. Meghan Keneally. PUBLISHED:. 11:51 EST, 9 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 15:51 EST, 9 September 2013. Olivier Sarkozy has turned his political attention to American campaigns as he is hosting a fundraiser supporting Massachusetts congressman Joseph Kennedy. Sarkozy, who is the half-brother of former French Prime Minister Nicholas, lives in New York and is dating Mary Kate Olsen. It is unclear why the 44-year-old banker is interested in a Congressional race in Massachusetts, hinting that he may be trying to make inroads with another famous political family. Political activist: Olivier Sarkozy (seen here with his girlfriend Mary Kate Olsen in November) is hosting a fundraiser in New York for Congressman Joe Kennedy from Massachusetts. Famous families: Sarkozy is the brother of the former French prime minister and Kennedy is the grandson of former Attorney General Robert Kennedy. Congressman Kennedy is the only member of the former president's extended family serving in Washington at the moment. The New York Post reports that Sarkozy- who has dual American and French citizenship- sent an email inviting guests to his home for a fundraiser on October 7. 'I believe Joe is the kind of new leader we need in Washington,' he wrote in the email. 'He is pragmatic, principled, and willing to look past party labels in the interest of getting things done... he brings fresh energy and much-needed perspective to our long-term economic and social challenges.' Republican ties: The only other political donations Sarkozy has made have been to Senators Mitch McConnell (left) and John Cornyn (right), both of whom are Republicans and neither of whom represent Sarkozy's home state of New York. It is unclear how many guests have. been invited, but each has been encouraged to contribute between $1,000. to $5,200 to attend and be named as a co-chair. This. is not the first time that Sarkozy has donated to American political. campaigns, but it is the first time in recent years that he has contributed to a. Democratic candidate. According to the Center for Responsive. Politics, Sarkozy has donated to both Senator Mitch McConnell of. Kentucky and Senator John Cornyn of Texas. Both donations were for $1,300 a piece and they were made on June 13 of this year. New York Magazine reported that in 2004 during his marriage to his now-ex-wife Charlotte, the couple donated $5,000 to the John Kerry presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. 'They were really the first political couple in France. They were always compared to the Kennedys,' showing another interesting overlap to the dinner fundraiser for Joseph.

""I think I'm taking up your air time,"" Dr. Jan Adams tells CNN's Larry King before walking off. ""I want to thank you for this opportunity,"" Dr. Jan Adams told King. ""Basically, I had come here to talk about things in the press that aren't accurate about me. ""But I have a tremendous amount of love and respect for the West family. They asked me not to go on. And I've said from the very beginning, I don't have a side in this,"" Adams said. ""They are my side, and I'm going to respect their wishes. I'm going to apologize to you because I think I'm taking up your air time, but I will not be on the show and I'm not going to discuss any of that. I'm going to honor their wishes."" When King asked Adams if he would ever answer questions regarding the West case, he said, ""I will talk with them,"" meaning her family. ""When they are comfortable, then I will be comfortable. If they are never comfortable, then I will never be comfortable. They are what's important to me,"" Adams said. Asked whether he wanted to speak out, Adams said he did not, removed his earpiece and left the set. Watch Adams walk off ». Earlier, as the show began, King said Adams had received a letter from West's family, saying that if Adams discussed West's case on the show, the family would ask the Medical Board of California to decertify him. Adams' brief appearance and walkout followed discussions with his attorney and ""Larry King Live"" producers. ""To the extent there are issues about even why he's here, why this is in the media, it relates to the relationship he had with his patient,"" Alan Tenenbaum, one of West's attorneys, told King. Watch CNN's Lola Ogunnaike describe the backstage drama ». ""So until he gets clearance from the family, I don't think it would be fair or right for him to talk about these things.""

Adams told TMZ.com that he performed a tummy tuck and breast reduction on West and that her death was unforeseen.

"A contractor has emerged as a possible suspect in the murder of a Brooklyn slumlord whose charred corpse was found in a dumpster earlier this month. The suspect has been linked to a Dodge minivan that was used to abduct Menachem Stark outside his real estate firm in Williamsburg during a blizzard on January 2. Police said on Thursday that they suspect Stark may have been killed over a single $20,000 debt that he owed to one individual. The landlord owed millions to various creditors. It was suggested by investigators that Stark's death may have been accidental with the kidnap intended to scare him into coming up with the money. Scroll down for video. A contractor who allegedly murdered slumlord Menachem Stark was owed $20,000 by the Brooklyn developer, it has been claimed. In the days before his brutal death, Stark had begged business associates to lend him a six-figure amount and had a Borough Park developer put up half a million dollars for him. The contractor suspect has also been connected. to a cellphone which investigators found attached under Stark's car. The phone is believed to have been used to track Stark's whereabouts before he was. snatched off the street. Police told the New York Post that associates of the individual that Stark owed money may have grabbed him. On Tuesday, police. found the 2002 Dodge minivan with Pennsylvania plates which was caught. on surveillance footage during Stark's abduction. The van was found in Brownsville, Brooklyn but appears to have been washed and wiped clean, police sources said. Murdered: The charred body of Menachem Stark, a father-of-seven, was found in a Long Island dumpster in early January. A man has now been arrested over his killing. Detectives seized the vehicle as a man got in and tried to drive off. The man was questioned by police but not charged. Footage released last week showed one of the suspects walking. from the van past Mr Stark's office, before returning to the vehicle. where he remained for hours. Stark was abducted on January 2 and found dead the next day in a dumpster behind a convenience store in Great Neck, Long Island. Finding. the van was a major breakthrough in the disturbing kidnapping and. killing of Stark, a 39-year-old father of eight children. Moses.

"The U.S. will keep a larger force in Afghanistan for the first few months of 2015 than it initially planned to, outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Saturday. During a joint press conference with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, Hagel said that up to 10,800 troops will remain in the country at the start of next year; a previous announcement called for 1,000 fewer troops. Hagel arrived in Afghanistan on Saturday in order to assess the nation as the United States begins the drawdown of its forces in the New Year, he said. He said that President Barack Obama authorized the change in force size in order to provide military commanders ""flexibility."" ""The President's authorization will not change -- it will not change our troops' missions or the long-term timeline for our withdrawal,"" Hagel said. Kabul has seen an uptick in Taliban attacks in recent weeks, a sign of instability that he said comes as no surprise. ""It's predictable that they would do everything they could and continue to do to try to disrupt and discourage the new government of President Ghani,"" he said. However, the spike in violence in the Afghan capital was not a factor in the decision to keep more U.S. troops in the country next year, a Defense Department official said. The decision is due to the late signing of the Bilateral Security Agreement, which allows a specified amount of U.S. troops to remain in Afghanistan after the combat mission ends this year. Ghani's predecessor, Hamid Karzai, would not sign a security agreement with the United States. Despite the attacks, the Pentagon said Afghan forces are performing ""well,"" and are now in the lead on 99% of the missions. ""The gaps are in aviation and ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance),"" a senior defense official told reporters on the flight to Afghanistan. This is his fourth and last visit to Afghanistan as defense secretary. His first trip to Afghanistan was 12 years ago as part of a Congressional delegation. Asked by CNN how he would define victory more than a decade later Hagel said the people of Afghanistan are far better off today than they were 13 years ago, citing an elected government and a national security force. ""They're not completely there yet, but they've come a long way,"" Hagel said. ""That's to the credit certainly of the United States, the sacrifice, the blood and the treasure that we've made there."" His visit comes after the establishment of a new unity government in the fall, which Hagel will express strong support for during his trip, a second senior defense official said. The drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan will be ""gradual"" compared with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, the first official said. In 2016, the number of troops will slide down to 5,500 and by 2017 the coalition will consolidate to Kabul. ""As we draw down the combat mission, we have not forgotten what brought America to Afghanistan over a decade ago,"" Hagel said on Saturday. UK formally ends combat mission in Afghanistan. Maintaining a troop presence will allow the U.S. to monitor the progress of the Afghan security forces over time, according to the first official. ""The Afghan people and the Afghan government...have asked us to stay,"" Hagel said contrasting the drawdown to the withdrawal troops in Iraq, where the U.S. could not negotiate an agreement that would allow a residual force in the country. The trip to Kabul follows Kabul's announcement last month that he will step down as soon as the Senate confirms his successor. Obama announced Friday that Ashton Carter will be his nominee to replace Hagel. Hagel, who has served as defense secretary since February last year, was forced out by Obama, several sources told CNN. During remarks announcing his resignation, Obama praised him as an ""exemplary"" defense secretary, calling him critical to various</s>","Up to 10,800 U.S. troops will remain in Afghanistan at the start of 2015.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona stand-in coach Jordi Roura suffered another agonizing display on his competitive return to the stadium that effectively ended his playing career. Twenty-four years on from suffering a cruciate ligament injury while playing for Barcelona in the San Siro, that same old sinking feeling returned for a man holding the reins as regular coach Tito Vilanova undergoes medical treatment for a tumor in New York. Fielding a strong side against a Milan team that failed to beat the Spaniards in last season's four European Champions League meetings, Barcelona lost the first leg of the last 16 clash 2-0. After a tight first half, Kevin-Prince Boateng broke the deadlock after 56 minutes when drilling home from the edge of the box after a Riccardo Montolivo drive was deflected into his path. Nine minutes from time, fellow Ghanaian Sulley Muntari sealed Milan's first Champions League win over Barca in 13 years after he stylishly finished off a sweeping move involving Stephan El Shaarawy and new signing M'Baye Niang. The victory was especially satisfying for the Milan hierarchy and club president Silvio Berlusconi, who may hope the unexpected win represents a good omen as the 76-year-old tries to return to office in this weekend's Italian elections. Following last year's comprehensive 3-1 aggregate defeat against Lionel Messi and colleagues in the Champions League quarterfinals, Milan overhauled their squad -- with Gennaro Gattuso, Clarence Seedorf, Alessandro Nesta and Zlatan Ibrahimovic among those moved on. A total of eleven players who took part in the 2012 clashes were sold, reducing the average age of the squad from 30 to 27, and the team has slowly overcome a difficult bedding-in period to rise up to fourth in Serie A. Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri had spoken of the need before the game to find a way of blunting Barcelona's attacking threat and his plan worked to perfection thanks to the on-field discipline of his players. ""We played as a team and we listened to our coach,"" said Muntari, whose goal was his first ever in the Champions League. ""He did a fantastic job by setting us up us very well on the pitch -- and we were very disciplined and managed to close every angle."" CNN Football Club: Send in your questions for Ian Wright. Even though Milan are seven-time European champions, their tally second only to the nine of Barcelona's great rivals Real Madrid, exuberant celebrations spread out across the stadium as the four-time winners fell without scoring an away goal. Roura has never made any claims to wanting to be a permanent coach and he suffered in Milan where the home side's impressive defensive discipline smothered the usual attacking prowess of a side standing 12 points clear in the Spanish league. His side were unable to formulate an alternative to their usual fluent style until the stand-in coach chose to use defender Gerard Pique in a makeshift attacking role for the final minutes. Mustering barely a shot on target worthy of the name, Barcelona's limp display -- with Lionel Messi's impact wholly minimized by some efficient defending -- must have made Roura, 45, wish he could never return to the San Siro in a competitive capacity again. In 1989, he was an aspiring Barca midfielder when the then 22-year-old suffered a serious knee against Milan in the European Super Cup - an injury that would bring his career to a premature end four years later. His side are now in danger of failing to reach the Champions League semifinals for the first time in six years and Vilanova may discover that his team is out of the competition when he returns</s>",Milan win 2-0 in first leg of Last 16 tie to stun tournament favorites.

"By. Katy Winter. Growing up with three slim sisters Holly McHale, 25, always felt like the 'ugly duckling' having struggled with her weight from a young age. After two of her sisters got married, the office manager from Shrewsbury resolved to make a lasting change to her lifestyle and spent £10,000 on bariatric surgery. Having once weighed 21st and worn size 24 clothing, today she is around 13st and can fit into size 12 dresses. Holly dropped from 21st and a size 24 (left) to 13st and a size 12 (right), following gastric surgery. Holly's size meant she felt ugly next to her older sisters and it was also affecting her health. She said: 'My sisters never teased me, but I struggled with my body image since I was young. I was always the larger sister. 'I wanted to look like them because they always looked so beautiful and graceful. Today I’m much happier with the way I look, and I feel amazing.' Holly’s weight began to shoot up after her father Michael died when she was just 11 years old. She said: 'I was the one who found dad after he died and it was very upsetting. We were very close. 'My mother was so keen to look after me that she gave me everything I wanted. She was sad for me that I didn’t have my dad anymore, so she treated me with things like sweets and hot chocolate after school. 'It created a link in my mind between comfort and food that didn’t go away. I thought I would lose my puppy fat but I never did.' By the time Holly reached college, she weighed 16st and became the subject of bullying. She said: 'I was made to feel worthless and my self-esteem hit rock bottom. I was drawn to takeaways and convenience food. Things like Chinese and Indian food, takeaway sandwiches, burgers and chips, fried chicken, and bag after bag of salt and vinegar crisps.' Holly has three older sisters - Katie, 35, Lucy, 32, Aimee, 30 and in June 2010 Aimee became the first of the sisters to get married. Holly said: 'It was wonderful seeing my sister get married but I was devastated that I looked so overweight. An individual photograph was taken of me and I insisted it was taken out of the wedding album. I was so humiliated.' From left to right: Holly, Aimee's husband Keith, Aimee, Katie and Lucy on Aimee's wedding day. Holly decided to spend the £10,000 inheritance money she received following her father’s death on weight loss surgery to drastically decrease the size of her stomach (left, before, right, now) By the following summer, when her sister Lucy got married, Holly weighed 21st, her heaviest weight, and was wearing size 24 clothing. She said: 'I just wanted to look more like my sisters, because they looked so wonderful and happy. I’d struggled even to find a nice dress I could fit into. 'I’d tried dieting, but despite signing up for slimming classes, I’d always put on weight after losing a few pounds. 'I investigated getting surgery on the NHS, but I didn’t fit the criteria for the area I was in.'

"By. Ian Parkes, Press Association. Lewis Hamilton is wary of the effect the euphoria currently being experienced by Nico Rosberg could have on his Formula One world title rival's bid for a home race triumph in Germany this weekend. Rosberg departed the British Grand Prix on his first serious low of the campaign as he suffered his maiden retirement this season after finishing the opening eight races either as winner or runner-up. Up for it: Lewis Hamilton feels World Cup factor will boost his hopes at German Grand Prix. With Hamilton claiming victory on his own. home soil at Silverstone, the gap between the duo was also slashed to. just four points in the German's favour. But following that blow for Rosberg, in the space of a few days he then got married, watched Germany win the World Cup and signed a new long-term contract with Mercedes. In terms of attempting to wrest back the initiative from Hamilton, Rosberg could not have asked for more, and will now be buoyed by the backing of thousands of ecstatic Germans at Hockenheim. 'For every driver when he goes into his home race he gets a boost, and I think Nico will have that extra boost this weekend,' said Hamilton. On the charge: Hamilton is just four points behind German Nico Rosberg in F1 standings. 'Not least because Germany have just won the World Cup and the whole country is on a serious high. 'Hopefully that will also have a positive effect on the whole team, as Mercedes-Benz.' Rosberg, who concedes he has had a'very positive week', is naturally hoping to tap into the positive vibe that has swept his country in light of the World Cup triumph. Relishing the challenge: Lewis Hamilton arrives at the circuit in Hockenheim on Thursday. 'The effort of the team as a whole, how they all played together was really great to see and that's what helped them win the tournament,' said Rosberg. 'That's what we at Mercedes are trying to do as well, to really work well, everybody together, to make the most of it. 'We're also on the right track in that respect because to dominate the sport as we are doing indicates we work pretty well together as a team. 'Of course there's room for improvement, but we're going in the right direction.' The only low note for Rosberg over the past few days has been FIFA putting a block on his planned helmet design for this weekend. Sign of the times: Mercedes hospitality unit has been customised to celebrate Germany's World Cup triumph. Following Germany's fourth World Cup triumph via their 1-0 victory over Argentina at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, a thrilled Rosberg immediately sought to reflect his team's achievement. On Tuesday Rosberg tweeted a picture of the helmet he had planned to wear at Hockenheim, resplendent with the colours of the German flag. Primarily, it was adorned with four stars to indicate the number of times they have been crowned champions, whilst on top was an image of the World Cup. FIFA, however, caught wind of the situation and contacted Rosberg's manager Georg Nolte to inform him his driver would have to remove the image due to an infringement of its intellectual property rights. Defending its decision to ban the design, a FIFA spokesperson said: 'FIFA is obliged to take action against any unauthorised reproduction of its intellectual property in a commercial context. 'If FIFA would not follow up on any potential infringements of its intellectual property, it would risk losing its legal right and title to such works, thereby endangering the foundation of its commercial programme which is driven primarily by the access to and usage of our brand marks, including the FIFA</s>",Lewis Hamilton hopes World Cup triumph will boost his Mercedes team.

But now you might just find it’s a man standing on your door step offering up beauty tips. According to new figures, the ‘Avon man’ is the newest phenomenon of the recession, as men turn to direct selling after losing their jobs because of the downturn. There’s been a five per cent increase in representatives in just two years, with men making up a quarter of that number — a 26 per cent increase in three years. Game changer: David Heffernan had more than 50 unsuccessful job interviews and now earns more as an Avon salesman than at his previous job in insurance. ‘I knock on the door and say, “You clearly need this anti-wrinkle cream, do you want it?” And, bizarrely enough, that sales technique works,’ says David Heffernan, 39, from Knutsford, Cheshire, one of a growing number of unlikely beauty gurus. ‘When I was a child, I didn’t imagine I’d one day be selling lipsticks through letterboxes. I got a lot of raised eyebrows from customers when I started being an Avon man, but I enjoyed that surprise. Brush up: It seems some of the new generation of Avon men may still need to brush up on some essential skills that ladies have down. ‘At first, I didn’t have a clue about. the products, but women seemed to like that naivety and now I use it to. my advantage to help me sell.’ When he was made redundant from his job in insurance last March, David had more than 50 job interviews. None was successful. ‘I was on the scrapheap,’ he confesses. ‘Every day I looked at my two sons, knowing I was supposed to be making something of myself for them. I felt like a failure.’ David’s wife of seven years, Emma, was an Avon sales rep and asked him to help her out.

Police warrants used to seize computer hard drives from the mansion of a suspected kingpin of an Internet piracy ring were illegal, a judge ruled today. Seventy officers raided the New Zealand mansion of Megaupload.com boss Kim Dotcom - also known as Kim Schmitz - in January as part of an investigation of his website spearheaded by the FBI in the U.S. Dotcom was one of four men arrested during the operation. He is accused of being the ringleader of a group that. netted $175million since 2005 by copying and distributing music, films. and other copyrighted content without authorisation. Dotcom's lawyers say the company simply offered online storage. Ruling: Police warrants used to seize computer hard drives from the mansion of Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom (pictured) were illegal, a judge said today. Dotcom is accused of being the ringleader of a group that netted $175million since 2005 by copying and distributing music, films and other copyrighted content without authorisation. But a New Zealand judge today found. the warrants used in the seizure of property from Dotcom's mansion near. Auckland were illegal. Justice. Helen Winkelmann ruled that moves by the FBI to copy data from Dotcom's. computer and take it offshore were also unlawful. She told the hearing: 'The warrants did not adequately describe the offences to which they related. 'Indeed they fell well short of that. They were general warrants, and as such, are invalid.' In. response, New Zealand's police said in a statement that they are. considering the judgement and are in discussions with Crown Law 'to. determine what further action might be required'. Police said no further comment would be made until that process is complete. Dotcom. is on bail in New Zealand, fighting attempts by U.S. authorities. seeking to extradite him on charges of copyright theft and money. laundering. An extradition hearing is set for August. Big operation: Seventy police raided Dotcom's mansion near Auckland in January. The judge also ruled that moves by the FBI to copy data from Dotcom's computer and take it offshore were unlawful. Television. New Zealand quoted a spokesman for Dotcom as saying he is 'pleased' but. would not be making any further comment on the court decision as. appeals are likely. Lawyers. representing the U.S. government said the ruling had come as 'no. surprise' and that their legal team would be discussing options,. including whether an appeal will be lodged. During. the January raid, armed officers, backed by helicopters, cut Dotcom out. of a safe room he had barricaded himself in within the sprawling. country estate, reputedly New Zealand's most expensive home. Millions of dollars in assets were seized or frozen, including almost 20 luxury vehicles, dozens of computers and art works.

"Pro-Russian rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine have announced plans to boost the size of their armed forces to 100,000 in a ominous sign for peace efforts in the war torn country. Alexander Zakharchenko, the leader of separatists in the state of Donetsk, said new mobilization plans aim to swell the rebels' ranks, although its not clear exactly how many fighters the rebels have now, nor how many able-bodied men are still willing and able to join them in rebel-held areas. The rebels have acknowledged that some Russian citizens are fighting among their ranks, but reject Ukraine's charge that they are getting military help from Russia. Western experts say the sheer amount of heavy weapons under rebel control shows extensive help from Moscow. News of the rebels' recruitment drive comes as fierce protests broke out in the capital Kiev, with fighters from the Aydar Ukrainian volunteer battalion burning tyres at the entrance to the Ukrainian Defence Ministry during demonstrations prevent the possible disbandment of their battalion. The volunteers are furious at the possible scaling back of Ukrainian defence forces as regime groups are already outgunned in the east of the country. This morning Ukrainian troops battled to repel waves of Russian-backed separatists trying to surround a strategic railway hub in eastern Ukraine. Elsewhere, the rebel stronghold of Donetsk came under heavy, sustained shelling once again. City authorities said that 15 civilians had been killed over the weekend in the fighting, while Ukraine authorities said five soldiers had been killed and 29 wounded overall in the east in the past day alone. Anger: News of the pro-Russian rebels' recruitment drive comes as fierce protests broke out in the capital Kiev, with fighters from the Aydar Ukrainian volunteer battalion burning tyres at the entrance to the Ukrainian Defence Ministry.

Demonstration: Servicemen from the Aydar battalion remove a national flag from the Ukrainian Defence Ministry building in Kiev. Since the unrest in eastern Ukraine surged anew in early January, the separatists have made notable strides in clawing territory away from the government in Kiev. Their main offensive is now directed at Debaltseve - a government-held railway junction once populated by 25,000 people that lies between the rebel-held cities of Luhansk and Donetsk. Almost 2,000 residents have fled in the last few days alone. Rebel forces have mounted multiple assaults on government positions in Debaltseve but all were repelled, a spokesman for Ukrainian military operations in the east, Andriy Lysenko, said today. 'The units that have arrived in support of our troops in Debaltseve are counterattacking and denying the enemy the opportunity to complete the encirclement,' he said. Separatist fighters burst through Ukrainian lines last week in the village of Vuhlehirsk on the road west of Debaltseve, getting access to a ridge overlooking the highway running north from the town.

"(CNN) -- After all the comparisons to George Zimmerman, Michael Dunn's fate turned out very differently. Dunn -- who also killed a black 17-year-old and said he did it in self-defense -- now faces decades in prison after he shot into an SUV full of teenagers during a spat over loud music. But this story is far from over. The prosecution wants another conviction. Dunn could appeal the convictions he already has. And once again, the country is at odds about whether race led to a young man's death. Meanwhile, Dunn's daughter told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that she's barely stopped crying since the verdict was handed down and she struggles to imagine ""life without him."" ""I love him so much. He's my best friend,"" Rebecca Dunn tearfully said. ""If he sees no other way than to bring out his gun, that's what he's going to do,"" she said. Both sides to keep fighting. After 30 hours of deliberation, a Florida jury on Saturday found Dunn guilty of three counts of attempted murder as well as a count stemming from shooting into the teens' vehicle. But jurors didn't convict him of murder for the death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis. State Attorney Angela Corey said prosecutors will seek a new trial in Duval County on the murder charge. ""Justice for Jordan Davis is as important as it is for any victim,"" said Corey, whose office also prosecuted Zimmerman for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was acquitted. Even without a murder conviction, Dunn faces a lengthy prison term. Each attempted second-degree murder conviction carries a minimum sentence of 20 years. There's also a possible 15-year sentence for the conviction on shooting into the teenagers' vehicle. ""You are looking basically at life in prison,"" Dunn's attorney Cory Strolla said. ""At 47 years old, that's a life sentence regardless of count one."" Strolla said he would challenge the convictions and would consider asking for a change of venue. ""For the retrial, I almost think we would have to,"" the attorney said. ""But again, I may not be the counsel at that point. We are a long ways away from that."" Opinion: An empty verdict, a hollow victory. Analysts disagree. Criminal defense attorney Carrie Hackett, who was not involved in Dunn's case, said she thinks the case may have been another example of overcharging. ""I think that there is an issue of overcharging because there's always a question when you bring a charge that involves intent,"" she told ""CNN Newsroom"" on Sunday. ""And in this first-degree murder charge, it's premeditation. When a jury has to look at -- did somebody plan? Was this strategic? Did they communicate this plan to somebody else? That's a situation where a jury could very easily get hung up on deciding, what was the person's intention?"" But another attorney, Mo Ivory, said she didn't think Dunn or Zimmerman was overcharged. ""What I do think is that the prosecution failed to give the jurors what they needed to know about that very intent,"" Ivory said. Ten bullets over music. On November 23, 2012, Michael Dunn pulled into a gas station in Jacksonville and parked next to a red Dodge Durango full of teenagers.

"President Obama made time for beer and billiards in Colorado, but won't go near a humanitarian crisis in Texas, a disgusted Democratic member of Congress from the Lone Star State said Wednesday. Rep. Henry Cuellar crossed his party to say he is'very very upset' with Obama for choosing a photo op with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper over a chance to see firsthand how his administration is handling a flood of young illegal immigrants who have trekked to the U.S. from three Central American countries. 'He's so close to the border. And let me say this: when I saw, and I hate to use the word bizarre, but under the circumstances, when he is shown playing pool in Colorado, drinking a beer, and he can't even go 242 miles to the Texas border?' Cuellar added that the federal government is 'holding some of the young kids from the border' at Lackland Air Force Base. 'He could at least make that trip to San Antonio,' he said. Scroll down for video. 'That's some tasty beer!' President Barack Obama has a beer at Wynkoop Brewing Co. with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper on Tuesday. Eye on the prize! Obama plays pool with Gov. John Hickenlooper keeping watch. 'He either can roll up his sleeves and go down to the border, or he can just look aloof and detached and not go to the border – send surrogates down there – and say that he's got everything under control.' 'It Just floored me,' a visibly perturbed Cuellar told MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell, 'because if he’s saying he's too busy to go down to the border, but you have time to drink a beer, play pool – the optics and the appearance just mean he's not paying attention to this humanitarian crisis.' Cuellar told Fox News on Wednesday morning that the White House has already pressured him to keep quiet. Obama will be in Texas on Wednesday afternoon and evening for Democratic Party fundraisers in Dallas and Austin. It's as close to the crisis as he's traveled since the human deluge became a public scandal. During the first speech of his two-day trip, Obama didn't mention the border situation, saying only that his flavor of 'immigration reform' is'supported by a majority of Americans.' MailOnline was first to report last week that the president would steer clear of the state's besieged border with Mexico. Arizona Democratic Rep Ra<unk> l Grijalva said Tuesday on the same network that that the Southwest U.S. border 'deserved a presidential visit.' I think a visit by the president is reaffirming that the borderlands along the southwest border are vital and important to this nation,' he said,'so I think a visit would be important and very symbolic.' 'This issue isn't going to go away... while he's in Austin and Dallas,' Grijalva insisted. Humanitarian disaster: Young girls and boys are trapped in detention facilities after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border -- tens of thousands have descended on Texas and Arizona since last year. This child, not that child: Obama hugged a young girl in Denver but has no plans to see thousands of less fortunate children massed on the U.S. border a few hundred miles south of his Texas travel swing. Buzzfeed on Wednesday quoted unnamed Democratic members of Congress who called Obama's failure to see the border crisis firsthand 'confusing,' 'baffling' and 'a little offensive.' Washington Post scribe Ruth Marcus added</s>","When the president touches down in Texas for two Democratic fundraisers, he won't go near the U.S.-Mexico border. Some Democrats complain that Obama drank beer and shot pool with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper but will make no time for a border visit. Obama aides, however, insist that the president might 'get in the way' if he traveled to the Rio Grande River valley. One</s>",<pad> By. Daily Mail Reporter.

A leading Republican blamed President Obama and his administration for 'outing' the Pakistani doctor who helped locate Osama bin Laden and who has now been sent to prison for 33 years. Representative Peter King, the New York congressman who leads the House Homeland Security Committee, pointed to White House administrators for identifying Dr. Shakil Afridi to Pakistani authorities. 'They put him out there,' Mr King said in light of the doctor's prison sentence for treason by the Pakistani government. Treason: Dr Shakeel Afridi, pictured left, was jailed for 33 year in Islamabad for helping the U.S. find Osama bin Laden by setting up a vaccination programme that led him collect DNA from the Al Qaeda leader's children. 'This has been handled very poorly right from the time of the raid,' Mr King told Fox News. 'They disclosed his identity.' The sentence is viewed by Western officials as punishment for humiliating the nation which claimed not to know it was harbouring the Al Qaeda leader. Pointing the finger: Representative Peter King says that the Obama administration revealed the doctor's identity, effectively leading the Pakistani authorities to him. Dr Shakil Afridi helped the CIA by running a fake vaccination programme that allowed him to collect the DNA of Bin Laden’s children from the family compound in Abbottabad. Sample analysis confirmed the terror leader was probably there and triggered the deadly mission by US Navy SEALS last May. It sparked a major rift between the US and Pakistani leaders who were embarrassed that Bin Laden had been living in a major military hub close to the capital. A furious Pakistan felt the covert operation was a violation of its sovereignty and implied the US was unable to trust its key partner in the war on terror. American officials have already started rallying on the doctor's behalf, urging the Pakistani government to overturn the sentence which is said to include hard labor and extensive fines. 'What Dr. Afridi did is the furthest thing from treason. It was a courageous, heroic and patriotic act, which helped to locate the most wanted terrorist in the world,' Senators John McCain and Carl Levin wrote in a joint statement. The Republican Mr McCain and Democratic Mr Levin both serve on the chamber's Committee of Armed Services. It is not clear if Dr Afridi knew who the target of the investigation was when the CIA recruited him, or what DNA he actually collected in the fake hepatitis B vaccination programme. Dr Afridi was accused of having taken half a dozen cooler boxes without authorisation. Mission: The Al Qaeda leader was killed at this compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Special Forces. Shortly after the raid which killed Bin Laden, Dr Afridi was arrested for conspiring against the state of Pakistan, his house was sealed and all assets frozen. A commission recommended a charge of conspiracy against Pakistan and high treason.US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta confirmed in January that Dr Afridi collected DNA in an effort to help locate Bin Laden but added he ‘was not in any way treasonous towards Pakistan. For them to take this kind of action against somebody who was helping to go after terrorism is a real mistake’. Dr Afridi had no right to legal representation, to present evidence or cross-examine witnesses. He must also pay a £2,300 fine or serve a further three-and-a-half years in jail. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called for his release. Tense: The moment President</s>","Dr Shakil Afridi led Navy SEALS to bin Laden by setting up fake vaccination programme that allowed him to take DNA samples from terrorist's children. Western officials say sentencing in Islamabad is punishment for humiliating Pakistan, who claims to not know Al Qaeda boss was living in Abottabad. Rep. Peter King says that Obama administration identified the doctor to Pakistani government officials, prompting his 33-year treason sentence</s>",<pad> By. Daily Mail Reporter.

"Destroyed: This iPhone charger started giving off smoke and melted soon after James Ward plugged it in at his home in Romford, Essex. An iPhone user has told of his shock after he saw the device's charger melt in his hand. Smoke started billowing from the end of James Ward's phone cable just a few minutes after he plugged it in to the mains. The cable then began to melt, instantly filling his home in Romford, Essex with the smell of burning rubber. The 25-year-old electrician says he. knew instantly that the device had a serious fault, and worried for the. safety of his young daughter. 'I started to panic,' he said. 'I know all about electrics, and stuff like that really shouldn't happen. 'I. normally plug my phone in and go to bed, but I had a couple of emails. to check. If I had gone to sleep, I dread to think what would have. happened. 'I've got an 18-month-old daughter - the consequences of what could have happened don't bear thinking about.' He bought the iPhone 5 and official 'Lightning' charger from an EE store about six months ago. Danger: Mr Ward worries that the malfunction could have seriously harmed his family. 'I don't know what caused it to heat up, I didn't do anything different and the cable hadn't frayed at all,' Mr Ward said. 'I'm never going to leave my phone unattended again - I don't want to put my family at risk and this happening once was once too often for my liking.' Both Apple and EE have failed to respond to a request for comment on Mr Ward's case. The eight-pin Lightning connector has. been a source of controversy ever since it was introduced to coincide. with the launch of the iPhone 5 in 2012.

"(Departures) -- It's not hard to identify the cultural capitals of the world. Cities such as Paris, Rome, London, Istanbul, Berlin and New York are the first-round picks for travelers seeking the best of fine art, architecture, history, music and food. And deservedly so — any one of these towns offers such an embarrassment of riches, it would be easy to spend a lifetime exploring their greatest hits. With Paris's museums and Rome's architecture, Berlin's art scene and New York's gastronomy, why bother looking farther afield? There are, actually, many reasons. Some of the world's best, most interesting cultural offerings, monuments and movements can be found outside the major centers. As any well-traveled polyglot knows, some of the best finds require veering off the beaten path (and perhaps down the stairs and through an unmarked door). For every well-trod favorite there is a lesser-known city with a buzzing cultural scene worth discovering and mercifully few tourists vying for access to the best sites. Departures: World's most cultured beach cities. Those visiting Germany, for example, might skip Berlin in favor of Dresden, a gorgeous Baroque metropolis that was the center of German high culture until it was destroyed during World War II. Its famous philharmonic survived, though, and a painstaking restoration process has revitalized the city as a destination for art and architecture. Or contemplate Helsinki: The Finnish capital rarely makes the list of European places to visit, but the city, named 2012's World Design Capital, is exploding with new design initiatives, cutting-edge architecture and creative innovation. Whether undergoing a renaissance or remaining a well-kept secret, all the destinations on this list are — suffice it to say — worth the journey. GALWAY, Ireland. The scene: A seaside sampling of traditional Irish heritage. The signature: Galway lies on the coast of Ireland, in a part of the country strongly connected to traditional Irish culture. (Many of the city's outlying villages are primarily Gaelic-speaking.) Visit Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe, the country's national Irish language theater, to get a taste of the interplay between Ireland's heritage and the city's art scene. Insider knowledge: Galway is a wonderful place to hear traditional Irish music — or ""trad"" music. Skip tourist traps and opt instead for local pubs like Crane Bar. Don't miss: The beautiful St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church, which was built in 1320 and has the distinction of being the largest medieval parish church in the country. ALMATY, Kazakhstan. The scene: A post-Perestroika bloom of experimental art and theater against a backdrop of traditional architecture flourishes. The signature: For an introduction to Kazakh culture, visit the National Museum, which stands across from the presidential palace and offers exhibits on Kazakh art and history. Afterward visit idyllic Panfilov Park to see St. Ascension Cathedral, which is one of the largest wooden structures in the world built entirely without nails. Insider knowledge: The theater scene is where the most interesting, cutting-edge art is happening.

After 11 hours and five minutes, spread over three days, the 6-foot-9 American finally broke his French opponent's serve in the 138th game of the fifth set, putting an end to one of the most extraordinary matches of tennis ever played. The final score read 6-4 3-6 6-7 7-6 70-68. Interviewed after the match, Isner had warm praise for Mahut. ""What can I say, The guy is an absolute warrior. To share this day with him was an absolute honor. I wish him nothing but the best. Maybe we'll meet again somewhere down the road and it won't be 70-68,"" Isner told the BBC. Mahut described the last three days as an amazing experience. ""The Crowd was fantastic, John deserved to win,"" he told the BBC. Immediately after the match ended, officials from the All England Club presented both players with momentos for their record-breaking feat. The players then posed for a photograph by the scoreboard, alongside match umpire Mohamed Lahyani. A huge crowd greeted the players as they returned to Court 18 a little after 2.30pm GMT, Thursday, with spectators and press lining the walkways above the court. Isner, serving first, took the opening game of the day, but Mahut followed up by holding his serve to level the match 60 games all.

"(CNN) -- Nearly a decade has passed since Bill Clinton left the White House, but despite becoming a private citizen, the former president never left the public eye. Former President Clinton receives flowers from a girl Tuesday upon landing in Pyongyang, North Korea. While much of his time has been devoted to global philanthropic interests and speeches, Clinton has never strayed too far from the campaign trail and remains one of the world's most recognizable statesmen. Clinton, 62, jumped back onto the world stage Tuesday with an unannounced trip to North Korea on a mission to negotiate the release of two imprisoned American journalists. North Korean President Kim Jong Il later pardoned and released the journalists. They were traveling back to the United States with Clinton on Tuesday night. The United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea. Clinton arrived to a warm welcome in Pyongyang. Watch more on Clinton's North Korea trip ». There is a lot of nostalgia in Pyongyang for his administration, when relations between North Korea and the U.S. were stronger, said John Glionna, the Seoul, South Korea, bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times. ""Well, I think most of the people that I talked to in Washington earlier today were of the opinion that Bill Clinton is a big enough personality that would not risk the loss of face of him showing up in Pyongyang and returning empty-handed,"" Glionna said. Clinton's high profile has led critics to accuse him of upstaging his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, especially when he was making headlines while campaigning for her unsuccessful 2008 presidential bid. His first major verbal stumble during that campaign came in the run-up to the New Hampshire primary when he told a crowd that then-candidate Obama's claim to have been an early and consistent opponent of the Iraq war was ""the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen."" In the ensuing media uproar, many Democratic activists -- African-Americans in particular -- came to believe that the former president had belittled Obama's entire campaign effort. And while stumping for his wife in heavily black South Carolina, he seemed to try to minimize the impact of an Obama win by noting that the Rev. Jesse Jackson also won the state in 1984 and 1988 but went on to lose both nominations by wide margins. Critics accused the former president of trying to peel off Obama's white supporters by marginalizing him as the black candidate. Clinton's hesitancy to back Obama once he locked in the Democratic nomination also fueled the storyline of the Clinton-Obama riffs. But in a high-drama moment last year at the Democratic National Convention, both Clintons announced their wholehearted support for their party's nominee. Bill Clinton's name was tossed around as a possible pick to fill his wife's vacant Senate seat after she was selected as secretary of state. His name comes up in discussions of possible Supreme Court picks that Obama might have the opportunity to make. Before his wife's presidential campaign, Clinton focused most of his efforts on the William J. Clinton Foundation. The foundation's projects include the Clinton Global Initiative, which seeks to combat poverty and climate change and promote health and education programs worldwide as well as separate initiatives directed at childhood obesity, global warming, HIV/AIDS and malaria, inner-city entrepreneurship and economic growth in Latin America. It also funded the construction of the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas. The foundation boasts more than 800 staff and volunteers around the world. In his post-presidency, Clinton also has shared the stage with former President George H.W. Bush on numerous occasions.

"He has been nicknamed 'the poorest president in the world', but the President of Uruguay proved that he has a generous nature, at least, when he recently gave a lift to an unsuspecting hitchhiker. Gerhald Acosta had been forced to leave his job at the Montes del Plata paper mill early and was walking home from work when a good Samaritan offered to give him a lift. The shocked hitchhiker told a local newspaper that it was only as he got into the car - the president's iconic 1987 blue Volkswagen Beetle - that he recognised that the elderly couple was actually President Jose Mujica and his wife Sen. Lucia Topolansky. Gerhald Acosta had been forced to leave his job at the Montes del Plata paper mill early and was walking home from work when a President Jose Mujica (pictured) offered to give him a lift. Gerhald told El Observador newspaper in Uruguay that 25-30 cars had already passed him by without stopping when the big-hearted head of state came to his rescue: 'I couldn’t believe it. The president was giving me a ride. 'When I got out, I thanked them profusely, because not everyone helps someone out on the road, and much less a president.' The accommodating president and his wife even allowed Gerhald to take a couple of photographs as a memento during the short journey, which he later uploaded onto his Facebook page. President Mujica and his wife are well-known for their humble lifestyle. Mujica, a former leftist Tupamaro guerrilla leader, famously eschewed the presidential palace after he took office in 2010, and continues to live in a ramshackle farm which is in his wife's name. He once declared that his blue Beetle - a symbol of his famously austere lifestyle - was his only asset, and he is thought to donate much of his £7,200-a-month ($11,000) salary to homeless charities. President Mujica and his wife are well-known for their humble lifestyle. Mujica once declared that his 1987 Volkswagen Beetle - a symbol of his famously austere lifestyle - was his only asset. Since he assumed the presidency in 2010, Mujica has been dubbed the'most humble' president in the world. Earlier this year, the president estimated his total assets were worth £213,000 ($322,883), which is still far more modest that most world leaders. Since he assumed the presidency, liberal Mujica has led a radical overhaul of drug policies in Uruguay, setting a blueprint for other Latin American countries, and is also known for championing women's and gay rights. Mujica, a former leftist Tupamaro guerrilla leader, famously eschewed the presidential palace after he took office in 2010, and continues to live in a ramshackle farm which is in his wife's name. President Mujica - pictured here with his wife Sen. Lucia Topolansky, is thought to donate much of his $11,000-a-month salary to homeless charities. Commenting on his position, Mujica once told Al Jazeera: 'A president is a high-level official who is elected to carry out a function. He is not a king, not a god. He is not the witch doctor of a tribe who knows everything. 'He is a civil servant.

"(CNN) -- Even if you know nothing about IndyCar Racing or NASCAR, the odds are you know the name Danica Patrick. The trailblazing racecar driver has been exposed to a global audience through Super Bowl commercials, modeling shoots and other mainstream partnerships. She's helped IndyCar and NASCAR spread their audiences beyond core racing fans. That brand awareness hasn't been lost in the video game space. A few years ago Patrick worked with Activision to promote its racing game, ""Blur."" And she is one of the featured drivers in both of Activision's licensed NASCAR console games. Now she's partnered with Sega for its new arcade racing game, ""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed."" Gamers can race Patrick's converting vehicle -- it flies, drives and floats -- against popular Sega characters like Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails and Dr. Robotnick. Gamers can even put her up against Disney's Wreck-It Ralph for a virtual race. Patrick, who was recently named Nationwide's most popular driver by NASCAR fans, took some time to play the new Sega game and talk about her own gaming background in this exclusive interview for CNN. How big of a gamer were growing up and what did you play? I played a lot of games growing up, as any kid naturally would do. I played ""Sonic."" I played ""Super Mario Bros."" I played any kind of racing game that existed, I played ""Track and Field."" I shot some ducks with ""Duck Hunt."" Do you have a favorite Sonic the Hedgehog memory from back then that you can share with us? Can anyone really remember that far back? I think more than anything what I remember is playing the games when I would be on the road racing go karts, and being in my van when I went to the track with my family and playing with my friends at the track. I remember the places more than I remember exact memories about the games. What's it like being featured in ""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed?"" It's really neat to be a player in it, especially being such a famous game, such an iconic game. Being able to be able to be a player along with Sonic the Hedgehog and all the other All-Stars is very flattering and it's very cool. It comes full circle. How does this compare to seeing yourself in NASCAR games? NASCAR seems like it's kind of a shoe-in for me. So to be in something like a Sega game is to me more cool because it's something that's not common, and it's not given that I would be in those games. So I actually like it better. What tips or strategies would you give to anyone who is going to play ""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed?"" My suggestion would be to first off, pick me to play me because I'll be a really good one to choose. I'll be fast and I have lots of skills and talents and I shoot balls of flames. It disables cars and allows you to be able to get by them. I think you need to find out for yourself how awesome I am in the game. How popular are video games in NASCAR? Video games are pretty popular, for sure. I think given the fact that we're in a racing environment, racing games tend to be something that's obviously really common, so growing up I've played them and some people continue to play them and I think it's a good fit. What games are popular on the field these days during the rain delays? I know a lot of drivers play iRacing, which is more of an online thing. What impact do you think the hand-eye coordination required in video games has</s>","Danica Patrick has partnered with Sega for a racing game, ""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed"" Gamers can race Patrick's vehicle against Sega characters like Sonic the Hedgehog.

But send David Beckham into the Amazon rainforest and he turns from sporting hero... into a big wimp. Well, that’s what veteran explorer Michael Palin called him at the launch of a BBC documentary about the former footballer’s journey deep into the Brazilian jungle. Scroll down for video. David Beckham was pictured at the weekend with a greying beard, pictured left. On Monday, after his interview with Michael Palin, the silver had all but disappeared, shown right - suggesting he had resorted to dyeing it. And perhaps he wasn’t joking, considering the list of things that got Beckham’s skin crawling, including snakes, spiders and frogs. But the real horrors were the uncomfortable hammocks and lack of showers. The Armani underwear model told Palin, who interviewed him at the launch, that the greatest challenge was going without running water for days. Becks was jokingly labelled as a 'wimp' by veteran explorer Michael Palin at the launch of his BBC documentary about his journey into the Brazilian jungle. David Beckham: Into the Unknown shows the footballer and three friends venturing 800 miles into the Amazon by motorbike, canoe and plane. He said: ‘Showers and baths were clearly at a premium. That was the toughest part. As everyone knows, I like my cleanliness.’ He added: ‘Sleeping in a hammock was terrible. I couldn’t work out how to do it at first.’ Beckham, 39, admitted he found the wildlife especially creepy, saying: ‘On this trip I was like, “Snakes, not a big fan of, spiders, also not a big fan of”. 'But frogs were the thing I was kind of not sure I wanted to come across. And one of the first animals that we saw was a bright orange frog which unnerved me even more.’ The Armani underwear model spoke about his experiences with. Michael Palin, shown above. When Becks whimpered at the sight of a. frog, Palin said: 'You are a wimp really. David Attenborough would've interviewed it' Watching footage of Beckham whimpering at the sight of a frog climbing onto his hammock, Palin joked: ‘You are a wimp really. David Attenborough would have interviewed it.’ David Beckham: Into the Unknown, shows Beckham and three friends venturing 800 miles into the Amazon by motorbike, canoe and plane. He also admitted he found the steep dirt tracks they had to travel on ‘quite terrifying’, while the machetes used by guides to cut a path through the jungle made him nervous.

"Premier League newcomers Burnley have confirmed the signing of Chelsea midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah on loan. Burnley announced the transfer on twitter on Monday afternoon and the player said he was excited to meet his new teammates after returning from international duty with England under 21s. The 19-year-old midfielder has previously spent time on loan at Watford, Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough but Jose Mourinho feels he is ready for a taste of the Premier League. VIDEO Scroll down for Nathaniel Chalobah Ice Bucket Challenge. First team action: The 19-year-old has joined Burnley to gain Premiership experience. Chelsea already have 21 players on loan around England and Europe but Burnley have asked the Premier League table-toppers if they can continue to pay part of Chalobah’s reported £35,000-a-week wages. Burnley manager Sean Dyche has already signed seven players this summer including £2.5m striker Lukas Jutkiewicz and Michael Kightly from Stoke, as the club adapt to life back in the top flight. Dyche is also poised with a £3million bid for Bolton midfielder Mark Davies and hopes to wrap up the signing of Hull midfielder George Boyd on transfer deadline day.

"By. Bianca London. and Deni Kirkova. When MailOnline launched a competition for one lucky mother to meet Enrique Iglesias, unsurprisingly, the entries came in thick and fast. But one entry, sent in by Josephine Haydney's son Myron, really stood out so FEMAIL granted them the opportunity of a lifetime to meet the global superstar. Myron, 16, explained what a huge fan his mother was in his entry: 'She has absolutely adored Enrique for the best part of 15 years (since I can remember). Best day ever! Josephine Haydney and son Myron were granted the opportunity of a lifetime to meet global superstar Enrique Iglesias. 'Literally, every single day mum listens to his albums for at least an hour, if not...2 or 3 hours.' Myron went on to explain how his 7-year-old sister is severely disabled and relies on his parents for all of her personal care and needs. She suffers from a rare condition called Cask Gene Mutation, and when she received her diagnosis, she was only the seventh person diagnosed in the world. Tragically for the family, last August, mum Josephine was diagnosed with breast cancer. 'Because of this, my family's whole world has turned upside down,' Myron told us. 'Mum hasn't been able to care for my sister like she used to because she hasn't had the strength to. She has had chemotherapy and she has been really sick and I feel helpless as there is nothing I can do to help her. Hero: Josephine had breast surgery a few days before the meet and greet, so, explained Myron, to meet Enrique a few days later (on Mother's Day) would be 'out of this world' for her - and it really was. 'All I want is to see her smile again like she did on her last chemo session and if she met Enrique, I am sure it would give her the extra strength to carry on.' Josephine had breast surgery a few days before the meet and greet, so, explained Myron, to meet Enrique a few days later (on Mother's Day) would be 'out of this world' for her. He added: 'It's not fair because my mum always puts other people before herself and she is just a complete inspiration to me. 'It's easy for me to say because she's my mum but I have never known anyone who is so caring and warm -hearted. Great son: Myron says his mother (pictured, right, at her last chemo session) is a complete inspiration to him. 'I just think mum deserves this so much because Enrique is what gives mum strength at the moment, let alone if she actually met him.' Myron and Josephine were whisked down to London from Cornwall for a luxurious night away and met the superstar. Speaking after the event, Myron said: 'I wanted to give my mum something to smile about again. 'We had a fantastic time meeting Enrique. It's given my mum the inspiration to fight cancer and stay positive.' A thrilled Josephine said: 'Winning the competition made me think that anything is possible. 'I never thought I would make a 6 hours journey from Cornwall to London just four days after my breast cancer surgery. It was the best Mother's Day present I could've ever wished for.'

"The police chief who oversaw the bungled response to last year’s Buckingham Palace break-in has been handed a plum job in charge of Prince Charles’s household. Commander Peter Loughborough, head of royalty protection for more than ten years, is to become Master of the Household at Clarence House. In his new role, Eton-educated Lord Loughborough, 56, who is the 7th Earl of Rosslyn, will oversee all of Charles’s domestic arrangements, from his personal dining and official entertaining to making sure his flights are booked and his suitcase packed for trips abroad. Plum job: Commander Peter Loughborough, head of royalty protection for more than ten years, is to become Master of the Household at Clarence House. Above, the 56-year-old is pictured with Prince Charles and Camilla. He is taking over from Wing Commander Richard Pattle, a former royal equerry, who has been in the role since 2008 and is said to be ‘moving on to other things’. The move is sure to spark accusations of royal cronyism, particularly as under Lord Loughborough’s watch there have been a series of headline-making royal security scandals. Duty: Eton-educated Lord Loughborough, who is the 7th Earl of Rosslyn, will oversee all of Charles's domestic arrangements at Clarence House (above) The first major hiccup of his tenure came in 2003, when an intruder dressed as Osama bin Laden gate-crashed Prince William’s 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle. The following year, a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner dressed as Batman breached security to stage a protest on a Buckingham Palace balcony. Former Met boss Sir John Stevens described the security breach at the time as ‘unacceptable’. In 2009, Buckingham Palace suspended a chauffeur after undercover News of the World reporters gained access to highly sensitive areas of the building. Two journalists, who were posing as Middle Eastern businessmen, are said to have been waved inside at a police checkpoint, without security checks, and one of them even sat in the Queen’s state Bentley car. Arguably one of the most serious incidents occurred last September, however, when a man was arrested on suspicion of burglary inside Buckingham Palace. Two days later, jittery officers were forced to apologise to Prince Andrew when they challenged him at gunpoint as he took a walk in the palace gardens. Despite these fiascos, according to Metropolitan Police insiders, Lord Loughborough is a great favourite of the Queen. As one former very senior Met officer once said: ‘Peter speaks her language’. Security scandal: The police chief oversaw the bungled response to last year's Buckingham Palace break-in.

"An investigative journalism site has ripped apart reports the Malaysian Boeing MH17 was shot down by a Ukranian war plane, claiming to have exposed the images as possibly photoshop fakes. A report by Russian state television claimed to have discovered a'sensational' satellite photo of the last seconds of the doomed flight over Ukraine. The release of 'leaked' satellite images show a missile hurtling towards the passenger plane, while it was also claimed that the space pictures were from a British or US satellite. But following the release of these images, Bellingcat said suspicions were immediately raised by a number of online aviation experts, debating the inconsistencies, which lead to claims they were indeed 'fakes'.

Russian Channel 1 has released satellite images which suggest Malaysian Boeing MH17 (top of picture) was shot down by a Ukrainian warplane (bottom left) Aviation experts claims the images are actually fakes pointing out there is several issues including the type of aircraft (pictured) which conclude it is not a Boeing 777. Suspicions arose on Twitter that the images were not real including comparisons to the fighter jet (pictured) which was claimed to have shot down MH17. Bellingcat says it is clear that the satellite map imagery was created from a composite of different satellite map imagery. The news couldn't come at a worse time for Russian President Vladimir Putin who has already faced a rather cold reception by other world leaders at the G20 summit in Brisbane after Western leaders piled pressure on Mr Putin for the crisis in Ukraine and threatened more sanctions. The flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was travelling over the conflict-hit region when it disappeared from radar. A total of 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members were killed. Russian TV presenter Mikhail Leontiev claimed that the mysterious source who provided the images concluded they showed 'how a Mig-29 fighter plane destroys the Boeing passenger plane'. Suspicions arose immediately on Twitter, and inconsistencies were pointed out. This aviation expert pointed out the timeline of the images being posted online. Bellingcat said suspicions were immediately raised by a number of online aviation experts, debating the inconsistencies, which lead to claims the images, showing MH17 being shot down by a fighter jet, fake. But the citizen journalists site made claims that the images which were posted on a Russian message board on October 15th, claimed to originate from WikiLeaks, but that this contradicted their origin. Bellingcat said it was clear that the satellite map imagery was created from a composite of different satellite map imagery and that the fighter jet shown is reminiscent of an Su-27, not Su-25 as reported by Russian TV. There has also been questions over the plane's Malaysian airlines logo, with aviation experts concluding it's in the wrong place while the 'MH17' plane appears to be a Boeing 767 rather than a 777. The Bellingcat site said after all the evidence was presented, it was clear the images weren't credible, concluding Malaysian flight MH17 was not shot down by another aircraft. The West has repeatedly suggested the plane was shot down by pro-Moscow rebels using a Russian-made BUK missile system. Bellingcat says it is clear that the satellite map imagery is created from a composite of different satellite map imagery. The claims that the images were a fake obviously angered some who believed they were real. It was claimed that the mysterious source who provided the images concluded they showed 'how a Mig-29 fighter plane (pictured) destroys the Boeing passenger plane' A total of 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members were killed after MH17 was shot down. Russia</s>","Images of a fighter jet shooting down flight MH17 have been labelled 'fakes' Investigative journalism site, Bellingcat, says there are several inconsistencies with the images reported by Russian TV. It claims the images have shown the wrong airline logo, they did not depict a Boeing 777 and the type of fighter jet reported was also wrong.

"Extravagant: Khaled Khawaja and Rasha Said held one of the most expensive weddings in recent history. She first made a name for herself by donating money to the Tory party, just as her controversial billionaire father did in the past. But there was nothing conservative about Rasha Said's multimillion-pound wedding at France's Palace of Versailles this weekend. In scenes that defied David Cameron's austerity policies, the 26-year-old London-based socialite staged one of the most expensive marriage celebrations in recent history. The lavish affair was attended by senior Conservatives including International Development Minister Alan Duncan, at the palace that was once home to France’s notoriously spendthrift kings. Miss Said’s wedding to fellow PR worker Khaled Khawaja, 27, featured a two-hour live performance by pop star Robbie Williams and a 15ft-high tiered cake. AAmong the 700 British guests were the Duchess of York and her daughters, the Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, Princess Michael of Kent, Sir Michael Caine, Tory grandee Nicholas Soames, hotelier Sir Rocco Forte and his family, Samantha Cameron’s mother, Viscountess Astor, and Sotheby’s boss Henry Wyndham. It was paid for by 72-year-old tycoon Wafic Said, a close friend of Margaret Thatcher and one of the Tories' most prominent financial backers before being linked with a shady arms deal. Those who accuse Mr Cameron of being an out-of-touch member of the upper classes will also have raised an eyebrow at the presence of his mother-in-law, Viscountess Annabel Astor. Her daughter, Samantha Cameron, frequently tries to play down the family’s privileged background, as does Eton-educated Mr Cameron. Mr Said’s donations were banned during a sleaze crackdown because he was not deemed to be a British resident, but in 2005 Miss Said was recorded as giving £47,000 to the Conservatives. Then a teenager, she would not have had enough money for the donation, prompting claims that she had unlawfully acted as a ‘proxy’ to her father. But the Conservatives said it was a clerical error, and that the money had come from Rosemary Said, Miss Said’s British mother. An enquiry carried out by the Electoral Commission found there had been no wrongdoing, and Miss Said remains a Conservative supporter. On Saturday her family and friends filled Versailles, the palace most commonly associated with the Sun King, Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette. The monarchs’ high living cost them their heads during the 1789 French Revolution, but this weekend's guests had no thought of anything spoiling their merriment as they tucked into a cordon bleu vintage banquet in a resplendent state room. Dressed in black tie and ball gowns, they filed through the world famous Hall of Mirrors, where the Treaty of Versailles was signed to officially end World War I in 1919. On Saturday evening, the revellers were serenaded in the manicured Orangery gardens by Robbie Williams – a singer who is unlikely to provide a private performance for less than £1million. ‘It was an incredible celebration – one that couldn’t be more luxurious,’ said one of the guests. ‘Many of the guests were so rich they arrived by private jets, but even they were surprised by how lavish the whole thing was. 'The whole thing would have cost many millions. People came from all over the world, but there were plenty of Conservative Party supporters from England.’ Opulent surroundings: Revellers at the Palace of Versailles feasted</s>","Robbie Williams played in the Orangery and guests enjoyed a grand banquet.

Detectives said that a medical examiner found the boy's injuries consistent with him being inside a washing machine. 'What we feel is at some point the child was inside the washing machine in the home,' Garland police Officer Joe Harn said. 'According to investigators it is a front-loading type. For the child to be in the machine, the door had to be shut and it had to be started from the outside. It does not start by automatically shutting the door.' He would not comment on what role the father is believed to have played in the boy's injuries, but pointed out only he, the four-year-old boy and his 22-month-old daughter were home at the time.

"By. Steve Robson. PUBLISHED:. 19:36 EST, 17 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:38 EST, 17 May 2013. A woman branded morbidly obese by her GP has lost 21 stone in weight after an embarrassing trip to the dentists forced her to act. Denise Petty has gone from a size 34 to a size 14 dress after four years of shedding the pounds. She has lost so much weight, doctors told her last year a gastric band she had fitted was no longer working and she had been keeping the weight off herself. Struggling with her weight: Denise Petty, 42, weighed 36 stone in 2009 and could not go upstairs without struggling for breath. It took a trip to the dentist to spark the mother-of-one from Walsall, West Midlands, into action. Miss Petty said: 'It was just so embarrassing. I went to the dentists and they could not get the chair to lift me up. 'I knew then that if I didn’t do something about my weight I would be lucky to survive to the end of the year.' At the time in 2009, she weighed 36 stone and could not get up the stairs in her house without struggling for breath. She said she was depressed after years of weight gain and never allowed anyone to take photographs of her. 'The weight creeps up on you, year after year,' said Miss Petty. When she plucked up the courage to go to her GP, he warned her she was morbidly obese but it took the shock of what happened at the dentists to force a change of lifestyle. Result: The moment a dentist's chair could not lift Denise inspired her to take drastic action. She said: 'I couldn’t walk more than 20 yards. I avoided the GP because he always said the same thing, that I was morbidly obese, and you don’t want to listen, you don’t want to hear it. 'But it changed my mind and I knew I had to lose weight.' The 42-year-old health care assistant was referred by her GP to her local Weight Watchers group in Bloxwich, where she said she learned to're-educate' herself about food and change her lifestyle. 'It’s about smaller portion sizes and about moderating what you eat,' she said. 'It does get harder to lose the weight and to keep the weight off - the temptations never go away. 'But when I go to my group, I can talk to the others, we can have a giggle and people understand your issues, which has been a great help to me.' With the support of her family, she also took the step of having gastric band surgery at the Birmingham Heartlands hospital. 'We thought long and hard about the risks because there was a chance I might die while in surgery, but I felt that if I didn’t do something I would be dead anyway,' Miss Petty added. Two years later, her weight loss regime had been so successful she was told her gastric band had'stopped working' some months before and that she had been losing the weight by herself. Now, she can walk her dog without fighting for breath and is taking her driving test next month. She is also thinking about getting on an aeroplane to take a holiday abroad. 'I never wanted to face the embarrassment of thinking I wouldn’t fit in one of the plane’s seats and now I just don’t have that worry,' she said.

"A group of North Korean journalists could cancel a trip to Britain because officials in the secretive regime are paranoid about the spread of Ebola, it is claimed. The group had been expected to travel to the UK to learn online journalism skills and gain an understanding of the British media in a course part-funded by the UK taxpayer. But now North Korea's strict Ebola-control measures risk thwarting a project which had been criticised as simply teaching the regime's spin doctors how to more effectively peddle propaganda. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspecting a newly-built Mushroom Farm in Pyongyang: A plan for 46 North Korean journalists to visit the UK could be thwarted by the country's tight Ebola control measures. North Korea has been under effective lockdown for more than three months to keep the Ebola virus from crossing its borders, with all arrivals facing 21 days quarantine before they can enter the country. Since the Ebola measures were announced in late October, visas for nonessential travel have been halted and North Korean media has launched a daily barraage of constant reports depicting the dangers of the disease. North Korea's journalistic exchange trip appears to be the latest victim of the arguably over-enthusiastic health protection measures, according to a report in the the Sunday Express which cited 'Foreign Office sources'. The paper had earlier broken news of the expected visit by 46 journalists, who work in North Korea's tightly controlled state media and, its report claims, face execution if they dare criticise their country's regime. Lord Alton of Liverpool, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on North Korea, told reporters Caroline Wheeler and Alex Stevenson a cancellation could help the ministers avoid embarrassment. 'The Foreign Office might see it as a blessing in disguise if they can be given a reason for reconsidering giving a group of people whose speciality is propaganda rather than journalism the opportunity of coming to the UK,' he said. 'I think it has less to do with Ebola and more to do with the insecurity of the regime and their determination to try to prevent any influence by foreigners, aid workers or diplomats.' Kim gives field guidance to managers at the mushroom farm: The group had been expected to travel to the UK to learn online journalism skills and gain an understanding of the British media. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office last month it is funding the project, which will be delivered by the Thomson Foundation and is called 'Inside Out: Working in North Korea to connect its journalists to an internet world.' It was claimed it could cost the UK taxpayer as much as £70,000, but the FCO said no figures for the course had been finalised, and said it was being run as part of the 'critical engagement' activities with the country. In a written answer to the House of Lords Baroness Anelay of St Johns said 'The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) maintains extremely tight control over media and restricts access to foreign broadcasting.' North Korea is one of the most controlled media environments in the world. All news outlets are controlled by the state and information flowing into and out of the country is monitored.

"Newly-announced Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper has defended his potential awards vehicle, American Sniper, against criticism the film is a pro-war portrayal of 'a hate-filled killer who was treated like a hero'. The movie - directed by Clint Eastwood and based on the memoir of Navy SEAL sharpshooter Chris Kyle, who claims to have killed more than 255 people during his six-year military career - has come under fire for celebrating a racist 'American psycho' who referred to Muslims as ‘savage, despicable evil' and enjoyed killing. In one part of the book Kyle wrote: 'I couldn’t give a flying f-- about the Iraqis.' But Cooper, 40 - who has twice been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar but missed out both times - has hit back, saying the film is one man's story about being a soldier and shouldn't be treated as a political compass for or against the war. Scroll down for video. Shooting back: American Sniper star Bradley Cooper says the Oscar-nominated film should be looked at as the story of one solider and not a political tool. Memoir: American Sniper is based on the book by Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, who claims to have killed more than 255 people during his six-year military career. He was shot dead at a gun range in 2013. 'My hope is that if someone is having a political conversation about whether we should or should not have been in Iraq, whether the war is worth fighting, whether we won, whether we didn’t, why are we still there, all those (issues), that really—I hope—is not one that they would use this movie as a tool for,' Cooper told The Daily Beast. 'And for me, and for Clint, this movie was always a character study about what the plight is for a soldier. 'The guy that I got to know, through all the source material that I read and watched, and home videos - hours and hours - I never saw anything like that. 'If it’s not this movie, I hope to god another movie will come out where it will shed light on the fact of what servicemen and women have to go through, and that we need to pay attention to our vets. 'It’s not a political discussion about war, even... It’s a discussion about the reality. 'And the reality is that people are coming home, and we have to take care of them.' Cooper went on to say he doesn't think that American Sniper is so much concerned with Iraq as it is what it's like to serve in a war and then go home. Portrait: Cooper said he and director Clint Eastwood the story of Kyle (left) as 'a character study about what the plight is for a soldier' 'Our whole idea was to do a character study about a soldier, and a soldier and a family, and what it’s like having to deal with the schizophrenic nature of having to jostle between a home life and being in theater,' he told The Daily Beast. 'I think hopefully it could be a universal story.' While American Sniper has received support from the military and received a nomination for Best Picture today at the Oscars, liberals have attacked it for pandering to the narrative of a violent patriot. In one section of his book, Kyle wrote of one of his four tours of Iraq: 'If you see anyone from about sixteen to sixty-five and they’re male, shoot ’em. Kill every male you see.' Journalist Rania Khalek described Kyle as 'an American psycho</s>","American Sniper attacked for being 'a Republican platform' that celebrates war and killing. Cooper says it is a 'character study about the plight of a soldier' Has asked people to focus on the story and not the politics. Movie is based on the memoir of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, who some claim was a violent racist and 'American psycho' Cooper said he 'never saw anything like that' of Kyle</s>",<pad> By.

"The contest for the 2024 Olympics could feature two cities from the Middle East including Qatar capital Doha - with their chances boosted by proposed changes to bidding rules. International Olympic Committee member Prince Feisal Al Hussein, from Jordan, said he expects one or two bids from the Middle East for 2024. Olympic watchers expect Doha to bid for a third successive time, after its success in winning the 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships, while Dubai has also been mentioned as a possible candidate city. The Khalifa International Stadium in Doha could be a host venue at the 2024 Olympics if Qatar win the bid. Changes to IOC bidding rules to be decided in December could make it easier for countries in very hot climates to win the right to host the summer Games, by allowing it to be staged at different times of year to the traditional July/August slot, and with more flexibility in putting on some events in a different city or even different country. Doha secured the 2019 athletics showpiece on the basis of it being staged in early October rather than the usual month of August. Prince Feisal, speaking on a conference call as founder and chairman of Generations For Peace, said he would welcome the Olympics coming to the Middle East. He said: 'We have already seen in the 2020 Olympic Games we have an Arab country that looked to be a candidate city to host the Games and for 2024 we expect other Middle East countries that might consider putting themselves forward. Boston is in the running to host the 2024 Olympics - but it could face competition from the Middle East. 'As an Arab and a Muslim I would love to see the Olympics in our part of the world, as it has been in other parts of the world. 'I would expect that we will find one or two countries will be putting themselves into the bidding process and it is a question of what they have and what it takes to meet the IOC requirements and whether they deserve the opportunity to host the Games.' There are 40 proposals that make up Olympic Agenda 2020, the recommendations that will be put to the full IOC membership next month.

"By. Anthony Bond. Last updated at 5:42 PM on 24th January 2012. Prisoners serving life sentences are being allowed to keep pet budgies, canaries and parrots in their cells, it has emerged. More than 80 inmates at HMP Isle of Wight have been sold the birds at the discretion of prison governors for just £5 each. The prisoners, most of whom are serving life imprisonment, are given the pets after they are bred in the prison’s own aviary, based on the Albany wing. Albany wing at Isle of Wight prison where inmates are keeping birds. Lags are responsible for the care of their bird, including feeding and cleaning, and face being charged with an offence against prison discipline if they don’t. The Ministry of Justice says prison governors have the discretion to allow inmates to keep a small bird in their cell but according to the Prison Reform Trust, not many prisons allow it. The MOJ says allowing prisoners to have birds in their cells 'engenders a sense of responsibility as well as providing an interest, particularly for those serving long sentences'. A Freedom of Information request revealed 81 prisoners have pet birds at Isle of Wight - of these 63 have one bird and 18 have two. The type of bird is not always recorded but it appears there are currently 97 budgies, one canary and one parrot. The. pets are allowed to be kept under the Incentives and Earned Privileges. scheme, which is designed to encourage responsible behaviour. Pets: Prisoners can be sold birds such as parrots, left, or a budgie, right. Privileges are earned by prisoners through good behaviour and performance and removed if they fail to maintain acceptable standards. An MOJ statement said: 'Many of these prisoners take great pride and comfort in their birds. 'Prisoners are allowed to have sufficient property in possession to lead as normal and individual an existence as possible within the constraints of the prison environment. 'Every prison governor assesses the needs of their population and compiles a facility list which they consider appropriate for their local circumstances. 'Prison governors have the discretion to allow prisoners to keep a small bird in their cell. Other pets are not permitted. 'A prisoner who fails to care for a bird properly would be liable to be charged with an offence and the bird would also be removed and re-homed with another prisoner.'

"By. Associated Press Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 23:23 EST, 8 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 23:23 EST, 8 October 2013. Busted: Jon Sandusky, son of Jerry Sandusky, was arrested in Fargo, N.D., for DUI. Cleveland Browns executive Jon Sandusky, the son of former Penn State assistant Jerry Sandusky, was arrested early Tuesday morning on suspicion of drunken driving. Fargo police Lt. Joel Vettel told The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead that an officer spotted Jon Sandusky, 36, making an illegal turn. The officer pulled Sandusky over and decided he was driving under the influence after administering field sobriety tests. A worker at the Cass County Jail confirmed Tuesday night that Sandusky had been booked and later released. Sandusky is in his fourth season as Cleveland's director of player personnel after spending nine seasons with Philadelphia's personnel department.

"As some of the biggest stars in the world, One Direction are used to be inundated with fan mail. But despite receiving over 700 handwritten notes in just over a fortnight, these boys seem unaffected by their fans' adoration... because these are just the wax figures. Madame Tussauds in Blackpool have revealed that they have been overwhelmed with love letters for the wax stars, who took up residence earlier this month. Undeterred by the fact that these are neither living nor breathing versions of their idols, Directioners have been posting fan mail in their droves to the wax museum. Wax letter: Madame Tussauds in Blackpool have been inundated with fan mail for One Direction. Seeing double: The boy band's wax figures took up residence at the Blackpool attraction earlier this month. The letters have been turning up in the boys' clothing as fans leave behind their love notes after posing for photographs with the group. One letter was found in Harry’s blazer and another was hidden in Louis’s back pocket. Harry has received the most letters with 311, while Niall has been the second most popular so far with 193 notes. Madame Tussauds Blackpool has tasked Guest Experience Host and One Direction fan, Clarissa Croft with handling the letters, and ensuring they’re passed safely on to the boys themselves. Love notes: 'Harry' has received the most fan mail with 311. 'It’s been surprisingly emotional handling all these love letters from fans,' Clarissa says. 'I absolutely love the band myself, so I know how much One Direction means to them. These guys are the ultimate teenage crush. 'We made the decision to collect the letters to show the fans that they’re support is appreciated and to let the band know how loved they are. 'We’re delighted that the boys are in Blackpool and Directioners have the opportunity to come and meet the boys’ figures face-to face.' Remi Ryles, aged nine from Stoke-on-Trent who took the chance to hand deliver her letter, said: 'I love One Direction so much. I brought in my own letter and gave it Niall, he’s my favourite.'

"It's been nearly six months since Danica Weeks lost the love of her life. What happened to him? Where did he go? Is he dead? Or could he possibly be alive? These are just some of the questions which remain unanswered not just for Paul Weeks' wife but also their two little boys Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 1. How can life go on when all a grieving family has to go by are the conspiracy theories about how a plane somehow disappeared off the face of the earth. In an interview with Anne Barrowclough, for The Weekend Australian Magazine, the Perth mother-of-two spoke of her continual disbelief and utter despair ever since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 mysteriously vanished on March 8. All she's left with are the memories and his final parting gift - his wedding ring. Scroll down for video. Danica Weeks still can't fathom how Malaysia Flight 370 disappeared and took away her husband on March 8. 'Every morning I wake up and think, ""How do you lose a plane?"" I can't even begin to grieve yet,' Mrs Weeks said. She waited for days, weeks and months - still, nothing. Paul Weeks is among the 239 lost souls on the MH370 aircraft, which still remains missing. The 40-year-old says her life stopped the moment she was informed that her 39-year-old husband was among the 239 lost souls when Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 crashed into a remote area of the southern Indian Ocean. This wasn't part of their grand plan - of moving to Perth, leading a simple family life and most importantly growing old together. The couple first met 14 years ago at Oktoberfest in Munich. From then on, romance was born and they pair lived together in London for a couple of years until they relocated to Christchurch in New Zealand - Mr Weeks' hometown. But following the earthquakes, they decided to make the move to Perth in 2011 where they wanted to settle down and raise their two kids. On March 8, Mr Weeks boarded MH370 so he could make his way to Mongolia to start his new fly-in-fly-out job as a mechanical engineer. His precious final moments are ingrained in Mrs Weeks' memories, as she revealed that her husband gave her his watch and wedding ring amid concerns that something may happen to him at the mining site. He requested the wedding ring was to go to the first son who gets married and the watch to the second. But for now, Mrs Weeks keeps the ring close to her heart by wearing it around her neck. 'Every night now I go home and it's lonely, it’s very lonely. When you've had someone there for 14 years, how do you keep going when they're gone?' The mother-of-two with her boys Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 1 at their Perth home. Yet the grieving mother tries to keep it together, for the sake of her children. And while Mrs Weeks herself isn't able to put piece the puzzle together herself, she was left with the harrowing task of explaining to her two sons what happened to their father. For eldest son Lincoln, who's understood that his daddy has gone to work forever, he's left anxious that the same will happen to his mother. Witnessing how the tragedy has affected her child, Mrs Weeks is determined more than ever to bring closure to all suffering families. 'That's why I won't rest until I find out what happened to Pauly. That's why I won't let [Malaysia Airlines] treat him like a seat number. I have to keep him alive. And I won't rest until we find out what happened to him and to everyone else on that plane,' she said.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Kenneth Cole is the first to admit he has a bit of a language problem. Pun-loving Kenneth Cole pays tribute to inspiring people in his new book. ""I need to distort not just leather and fabric, but also words,"" he said. ""It's a disorder I have."" The pun-loving fashion designer has raised plenty of eyebrows with advertising copy that ranges from the provocative and the political to the lighthearted and cutesy. Browse his online store and you can buy a T-shirt that reads ""In war is it who's right, or who's left?"" A canvas tote bag says, ""Use me again and again and again... (I'm used to it)."" Should you purchase either product, you're assured that all your money will go to Cole's ""Awearness Fund,"" an initiative designed to draw attention to social issues like homelessness and AIDS. To that end, Cole has just released a new book called ""Awearness: Inspiring Stories About How to Make a Difference"" (DK Adult). It's a collection of essays from influential types intended to encourage readers to get involved in service and volunteerism in their communities. Watch Cole talk about 'Awearness' ». Former President Bill Clinton contributes a piece on the global fight against HIV/AIDS. Actress Rosario Dawson writes about empowering young Latinos to vote, and cyclist Lance Armstrong discusses the merits of starting a movement like Livestrong, his effort to energize the fight against cancer. As Cole says: ""No good deed should go unpublished."" Pun intended. The book commemorates 25 years in the fashion business for the New Yorker, as well as a quarter century as an advocate for social activism. Cole spoke to CNN about the book, the belief, his wife and the cover. (OK, so not everyone is brilliantly punny.) The following is an edited transcript of the interview. CNN: What is the big message you're hoping to get across with this book? Kenneth Cole: The message is that these are extraordinary times. They're transformative in so many ways. And America recently expressed the reality that there is an appetite for meaningful, significant, social change like we've never seen before. CNN: In the introduction of your book, you talk about how you've met a lot of people who have inspired you. Is there one person who stands out above the rest? Cole: There are so many people that inspire me, and there are 90 role models in this book, some of whom I've been very close to. I am the closest of all to my wife, who is in and of herself a change agent and has committed to impacting the realities of homelessness -- and making sure I get out of the house every day to do what I have to do. So she's inspired me and she's done great stuff. So I think I'll stay with that answer. CNN: In Robert Redford's essay on freedom of speech, he encourages the use of humor when speaking out about a cause someone feels passionate about. Has humor helped you? Cole: I think it does. I agree with Mr. Redford, and he's been a model of mine.... And I think we also have these walls around us, and when people disagree, we're inclined not to listen, but to a degree you can break through that wall often with humor. Jon Stewart has shown us how to do that, as have some other people who are in the art of doing it well. CNN: What's your biggest hope for President-elect Barack Obama's presidency? Cole: He has already surpassed my greatest hopes. I think he's created a sense of spirit and energy and opportunity in this country that we've never seen.

"By. Sarah Michael. Baby Ringo is bottle-fed every eight hours, cries for his mum and needs to be cuddled to sleep in the middle of the night. And while he lives in a house in North Ryde, Sydney and snuggles in bed with his 'parents' every morning, the 10-month-old isn't a human. He's a wombat. Ringo's mother was killed by a car and so for the past three weeks the tiny marsupial has been living with WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo keeper Erin Costelloe. Scroll down for video. Ringo's mother was killed by a car, so the orphaned wombat was taken in by a WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo keeper. Ringo the baby wombat lives with Erin Costelloe, 25, in her house in North Ryde, Sydney. He's catching up on the news! Ringo has made a name for himself acting like people. Baby wombats have very long care periods with their mothers – usually 12-18 months – and at his age it would be too distressing for Ringo to stay in the zoo overnight. Baby wombats have very long care periods with their mothers – usually 12-18 months – and at his age it would be too distressing for Ringo to stay in the zoo overnight. So for the next two months he will be staying with the 25-year-old, who lives in a share house with her partner and three other housemates. 'He wakes up and he calls for me,' Ms Costelloe told MailOnline. 'They make these weird noises, it's like a ""tss tss"" and I give him cuddle. 'Basically he just needs to know that mum's there.' He spends his days at the zoo in the exhibit but he needs to be monitored by a keeper at all times. 'He comes basically everywhere I go,' she said. He's hungry! Ringo gets a feed from his adopted 25-year-old mother, munching down on a carrot. When Ringo is 12 months old he will undergo a'soft release' in order to familiarise him the zoo at night. The 10-month-old wombat likes to snuggle in bed with Ms Costelloe's partner Alvin while she dresses for work. Ms Costelloe said taking care of Ringo was very tiring, but also very rewarding. 'I've got a puppy that's 11 months old, and when I get up at 3am and have to give Ringo a cuddle the puppy's jumping around like a toddler and he's sooking like baby. 'It's reminded me I don't want to have kids for a long time.' Ms Costelloe said her housemates are'very tolerant and accepting' and they have agreed to let her use a second bathroom in the house as a temporary wombat enclosure. Her housemates also babysit Ringo if she has to go out at night. Her partner Alvin, who she shares a room with, lets Ringo cuddle in bed every morning as Ms Costelloe dresses for work. 'I retrieve him and give him to my partner and he just keeps on sleeping and lets the wombat hang out on the bed while I get ready,' she said. Ringo needs to be fed a bottle every eight hours and Ms Costelloe and her partner often have to wake up in the middle of the night to feed him.

"An 18-year-old Good Samaritan has told how a man he tried to help beat him so savagely his own mother thought he was dead. Angus Gallacher had 13 skull fractures, three broken fingers, fractured ribs and eardrum damage and needed a titanium plate behind his right eye after the assault by 25-year-old Brian Ramsay. His family reacted with fury today as Ramsay, who dragged the teenager to his house to continue his attack, was jailed for 18 months - and he could be free in just six. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT. Injuries: Good Samaritan Angus Gallacher (left) had 13 skull fractures, three broken fingers, fractured ribs and eardrum damage and needed a titanium plate behind his eye after an assault by Brian Ramsay (right) Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard the teenager, who restores classic cars for a living, was unable to work for three months and is now afraid to leave his home in Newtongrange, Midlothian. He was walking home from a night out with friends in nearby Gorebridge in October when he discovered Ramsay lying on his back in a petrol station forecourt. The young mechanic helped him to his feet, took him to a shop to get some food and then helped him across the road - but then Ramsay unexpectedly turned on him. He subjected Angus to a brutal and sustained assault in the street before dragging him to a nearby house where he attacked him again. Appalling: A selfie which the teenager took to show the damage immediately after the beating. Shocked neighbours heard the attack and called police, who found the teenager lying unconscious in the street. 'He just turned on me,' said Mr Gallacher. 'My mind went a bit blank and all I thought was ""I should protect myself as much as I can"". 'He must have realised what he had done because he dragged me to his house to get me cleaned up. Then he hit me again in the garden and I have no recollection after that.' The teenager spent a week in hospital, where doctors discovered he had suffered such bad damage to his right eye that he had to have a titanium plate implanted behind his eyebrow. The youngest of three boys, he woke up in a hospital bed disorientated and disfigured. 'I was really confused when I woke up,' he said. 'I couldn't open my eyes as they were swollen shut. 'It has changed everything. You get all paranoid. I try to avoid going out on my own at night now. It would definitely make me think twice about helping somebody now.' Mr Gallacher's family attacked Ramsay's sentence after he was jailed for 18 months yesterday after admitting assault causing severe injuries, permanent disfigurement and danger of life. Because the 25-year-old had already been in custody since October 27, he could be free in fewer than six months. Mr Gallacher's parents Amanda, 53, and Henry, 56, branded the sentence 'disgusting' and called for better treatment of victims. 'He just turned on me,' said Mr Gallacher, who spent a week in hospital (pictured). 'My mind went a bit blank and all I thought was ""I should protect myself as much as I can""...

Human trafficking charges against a Saudi princess accused of holding a Kenyan servant as a virtual prisoner in her California home were dismissed by a judge today, after prosecutors said they were unable to corroborate the allegations. The 42-year-old princess, Meshael Alayban, smiled broadly as she left the Santa Ana courtroom after the judge lifted her $5 million bond, returned her passports to her and ordered that an electronic monitoring device be removed. Alayban had been charged with bringing her accuser to the United States in May, confiscating her passport and paying her $220 a month to work 16 hours a day, seven days a week in circumstances Orange County's top prosecutor likened to slavery.

But during a five-minute court proceeding that had been scheduled as an arraignment, District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told the judge, 'The allegations cannot be corroborated, the people move to dismiss.' The judge agreed, and defense lawyer Paul Meyer said in court, 'On behalf of the court and the nation of Saudi Arabia, we thank the D.A. for being a man of integrity.' Alayban, a wife of Saudi Prince Abdulrahman bin Nasser bin Abdulaziz al Saud, who is the grandson of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia was arrested in July. She was taken from her apartment in suburban Irvine, southeast of Los Angeles, and charged with human trafficking. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas dismissed charges against princess Meshael Alayban (left in Santa Ana courtroom today and right in her July mugshot) Attorney Paul Meyer (right) talks to the media after the Orange County District Attorney's Office dismissed felony human trafficking charges. Authorities said the case came to light after the Kenyan woman, who is about 30 years old, escaped from the residence and flagged down a bus driver. After Friday's hearing, District Attorney Rackauckas said the evidence from his investigation showed that 'the victim here was not really a victim,' adding that contrary to the accuser's account, she was free to come and go and received needed medical care. 'I think she believed she was a victim. I don't think she was lying to us. I think it was a misunderstanding and miscommunication,' he said. But defense lawyer Meyer said the accuser's claims were 'based on lies' and he issued a statement calling the allegations 'a scam to gain permanent resident status in the United States.'

"The days of ordering delicacies such as moules marinières could be numbered, as climate change threatens to change the acidity of the oceans. Researchers at Glasgow University discovered mussel shells become increasingly brittle when they are formed in more acidic water, leaving the creatures more vulnerable to predators. And the news comes after reports found the changes in an ocean’s pH levels can make shrimps and prawns taste more sour. Researchers at Glasgow University discovered mussel shells become increasingly brittle when they are formed in acidic water, leaving the creatures more vulnerable to predators. The acidity of the world’s oceans is changing as they absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide, which contributes to climate change. The acidity of the world’s oceans is changing as they absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide, which contributes to climate change. The water reacts with the carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid, which is expected to drop levels from pH 8 today, to pH 7.7 by the end of the 21st century. Marine biologists recently found that shellfish take on a sour flavour if they are reared in slightly acidified sea water. They warn that as the acidity of the planet's oceans changes, due to rising carbon dioxide levels, many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising. The researchers put hundreds of northern shrimp Pandalus borealis into two tanks of water for three weeks. They were either placed in sea water with a pH of 8, or in a more acidic tank with a pH of 7.5. Decreased pH reduced the score significantly for appearance and taste, but not for texture. Shrimp raised in the waters with the lower pH were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting, while those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest. Also the 63 per cent of the shrimp from the acidic water died during the three weeks. Mussels’ shells are made of calcium carbonate and organic material created by the shellfish through a process known as biomineralisation. They draw bicarbonate ions from seawater, and use proteins in their bodies to make crystals of calcium carbonate to form their two-layer shells. The shell’s outer later is composed of calcite, while the inner layer is made of aragonite. In acidic water, there are fewer bicarbonate ions available for the mussels to make these shells. The researchers, whose findings were published in the Royal Society’s journal Interface, altered temperature and pH levels for common blue mussels in lab tanks. This was designed to simulate four different levels of acidity predicted to occur in oceans over the coming decades. Study leader Doctor Susan Fitzer, of Glasgow University’s School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, said: ‘What we’ve found in the lab is that increased levels of acidification in their habitats have a negative impact on mussels’ ability to create their shells. ‘We worked with colleagues in our School of Engineering to examine the toughness of the shells of the mussels in the more acidic water against those in control conditions. ‘What we found was that the calcite outer shells of the mussels past a certain threshold of acidity was stiffer and harder, making it more brittle and prone to fracture under pressure, and the aragonite inner shell became softer. Mussels draw bicarbonate ions from seawater and use proteins in their bodies to make crystals of calcium carbonate to form their shells. In acidic water, there are fewer bicarbonate ions available for the mussels to make these shells. This effect, however, was reduced when temperatures increased by 2°C (35°F) ‘This could mean that mussels growing in the wild in the future could be more vulnerable to attack</s>","Mussel shells are made of calcium carbonate and organic material.

"Brooklyn, New York (CNN)A New York police officer was charged Wednesday with second-degree manslaughter in the shooting death of an unarmed Brooklyn man in November. Officer Peter Liang was arraigned Wednesday in Brooklyn Supreme Court for ""recklessly"" causing the death of Akai Gurley, according to court documents. In addition to the manslaughter charge, Liang faces one count of criminally negligent homicide, one count of second-degree assault, one count of reckless endangerment and two counts of official misconduct. He was released without bail. If Liang were convicted on the charge of second-degree manslaughter, he could face up to 15 years in prison. ""The defendant ignored his training"" when he used his firearm, lead prosecutor Marc Fliedner told the court. The defendant also did not try to help Gurley, instead retreating to a hallway and telling a fellow officer ""I'm going to get fired,"" Fliedner said. The prosecution will prove Liang made a ""deliberate motion"" with his firearm, he added. CNN tried to get a comment after court from defense attorney Stephen Worth but was unsuccessful. Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson thanked Fliedner and others ""who worked so hard on this case so that the judicial process could be conducted fairly."" Thompson also thanked NYPD officers for their assistance. It was important to ""recognize the courage and valor"" that many officers showed when they responded to the scene, he said. Several officers tried to stop Gurley's bleeding. Prosecutors don't believe Liang intentionally killed Gurley, the DA said, but he had his finger on the trigger and an innocent man was killed. Gurley, 28, was ""a total innocent who just happened"" to run into Liang in a ""pitch black"" stairwell at the Louis H. Pink Houses in Brooklyn, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters the day after the killing. At the time, the NYPD said the fatal shot was an ""accidental discharge."" Liang, with less than 18 months on the job and on probationary status, had been placed on modified assignment and stripped of his gun and badge pending an investigation. ""This officer deserves the same due process afforded to anyone involved in the accidental death of another,"" Patrick Lynch, head of the police union, said in a Tuesday statement. ""The fact that he was assigned to patrol one of the most dangerous housing projects in New York City must be considered among the circumstances of this tragic accident."" Liang and his partner were part of a ""violence reduction overtime detail"" at the Pink Houses, where a spate of serious crimes have been reported in recent months, including two robberies and four assaults, Bratton told reporters after the shooting. The officers had taken an elevator to the building's top floor to check on the roof and were taking the stairs down from the 8th floor, Bratton said, when the officer fired his weapon. There were no lights in the stairwell leading up to the roof. Liang drew a flashlight and his weapon ""for safety reasons,"" the police commissioner said. The other officer did not draw his gun. In the darkened stairwell, Liang's gun discharged about the same time that Gurley, the father of a 2-year-old child, and his girlfriend were entering the seventh-floor landing, Bratton said. Shot once in the chest, Gurley died at a hospital. The lights on the seventh and eighth floors were not working, Bratton said. The police commissioner said the decision on when to draw a weapon is the discretion of officers ""based on what they are encountering or believe they may encounter.

"Decades of illegal gold mining has turned vast swaths of Peruvian rainforest in to pocked, mercury-poisoned, desolate wastelands. In the south-eastern region of Madre de Dios, in the past decade alone, mining has stripped 230 square miles of forest and poisoned the rivers. It has left the area - a popular site for tourists and home to several tribes living in voluntary isolation - ruined and the lands scarred. Scroll down for video. Illegal mining in the Peruvian rainforest has left much of the region looking pocked, desolate and bare. A web of disused tubes lie in the dirt in the deserted wasteland in Peru's Madre de Dios south-east region. Peru is more than 60 per cent rainforest and only Brazil has a larger share of the Amazon jungle. Deforestation accounts for about 40 percent of Peru's greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to global warming. Trees absorb carbon dioxide through their leaves but as there are fewer trees, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap the sun's heat closer to the atmosphere which leads to the gradual rise in the earth's temperature. The South American country has lost an average of 113,000 hectares of forest every year since 2001, when 80,000 hectares were destroyed. Most of the destruction is done by illegal miners from outside the region, though thousands have left in recent months because of a government crackdown. Illegal mining is the second highest cause of deforestation in Peru, after clear-cutting for agriculture. The country has vowed to halt deforestation by 2021. Yet Peru's stewardship of its rainforest has been questioned by environmentalists, and deforestation appears to be on the rise. The issues were raised at the UN climate conference Peru is hosting until December 12. Peru is more than 60 per cent rainforest and only Brazil has a larger share of the Amazon jungle. An estimated 333,000 indigenous people live in the Peruvian rainforest - but their livelihoods are at stake because of the decades of illegal gold mining in the region that has destroyed much of the rainforest. Illegal gold mining has created a deep crater in the Madre de Dios region, which destroys plants and animals. A polluted river trickles from the Madre de Dios area - most of the destruction is done by illegal miners from outside the region. The indigenous groups that occupy the Peruvian Amazon have been hit hard by the deforestation. Peru's glaciers have lost more than one-fifth of their mass in just three decades.

The teen's heartbroken mother revealed the tragic overdose on Facebook just hours after it happened and hit out at two of Daisy's former friends who had written nasty messages to her just days before. Melinda Coleman also begged cyber 'hacktivist' organization Anonymous, which showed support for her daughter late last year when the story was in the headlines, not to abandon the case after she said they failed to follow up on any of her leads.

'My daughter has been terrorized to the point she tried to kill herself last night. She may never be ok. Where are you and your super hacking skills and internet help now.......we really need them.' Daisy was subjected. to constant cyber-bullying from classmates at her high school - and even parents - in the. quiet town of Maryville after she reported in January 2012 that she had. been raped by at least one older football player. She. told police the 17-year-old boy, Matthew Barnett, invited her to a. party where she became so intoxicated she couldn't stand and then had. sex with her while his friend filmed the incident on an iPhone. All. charges against Barnett, now 19, were dropped in connection with the. alleged rape last January. Dr Coleman and her daughter did a. string of media appearances in October to raise awareness of the case. and the bullying they were suffering but since then it has only. worsened, Dr Coleman said, driving Daisy to such extreme actions. Victimized: The high school student, pictured left and right, was subjected to constant cyber-bullying from classmates - and even parents - in the quiet town of Maryville after she reported in January 2012 that she had been raped by at least one older football player.

'When we got back here where we had to be quiet, it became really, really hard. For both of us.' On Friday night, Daisy briefly attended a party with a friend and arrived home to a stream of abuse on her Facebook page from two girls who she previously counted as friends.

Another girl allegedly chimed in, calling Daisy a 'hypocrite' for going to the party. Dr Coleman then attacked the pair online, sparking a heated back-and-forth argument. 'I was just really angry. I couldn't believe these girls were writing such horrible things to my daughter and defending it,' she said.

"Forget prawns, this year it's mussels that could be all the go this Christmas. It’s an Australian tradition to have seafood for Christmas lunch or dinner. But never mind prawns; freshly shucked oysters, salmon canapés, and crab salad are also all passé - it's blue mussels that were the connoisseurs’ choice at the 19th annual 36-Hour Seafood Marathon in Sydney Fish Market. The event saw the first of the Christmas catch sold at 5am on Tuesday, with trade continuing non-stop until 5pm on Wednesday, Christmas Eve. Current sales indicate that produce sold will be up on last year's figures, and blue oysters will be a popular choice.

As usual at the fish market prawns are very popular with local customers in Sydney. 'If you're looking for something a little different and a litter cheaper, but still very, very nice, then the blue mussels are a good buy at the moment,' said Brian Skepper, seafood expert and general manager of Sydney Fish Market. 'There's been good supplies around for them. Having them in a simple white wine sauce is as good a meal as you'll get anywhere this Christmas. 'Our climate lends itself to have seafood for lunch. It just makes sense. Christmas is by far the busiest time of the year for us now as far as seafood sales. 'The next is Easter followed by Chinese New Year. It has become a tradition in Sydney at Christmas to come down to the seafood marathon and do your Christmas food shopping. ‘Even at midnight the place is really buzzing. You’ll often see a family down shopping together for seafood for their Christmas lunch.' Apart from the blue mussels that sell for between $7-$11 a kilo, the selection is huge. The favourites tend to be prawns and oysters. Over the 36-hour period about 120 tonnes of prawns – about 55 kilograms every minute – will be sold. 70,000 dozen oysters will also be sold – almost 390 Oysters per minute. Based on prior years organisers are expecting to have over 100,000 people visit the market during the 36-hour period. Approximately 600 tonnes of fresh seafood will be sold through the wholesale market and retailers during this time. the prices and tyoes of fish are put on display at Sydney Fish Market. Customers will be buying seafood at Sydney's fish market over the next two days before Christmas Day. A seafood vendor packs a fish in ice to keep it fresh. Christmas is Sydney's Fish Market's busiest time. Some fish look more like they have just landed from an alien planet rather than being caught in the sea. It's a Smörg<unk> sbord of seafood. Depending on whether you buy a king prawn or a farm prawn they’ll range between $18-$40 a kilo. Pacific oysters sell at between $12-$18 a dozen. Sydney rock oysters between $14-$18 a dozen. In terms of fish, snapper, barramundi and Atlantic salmon are all the most popular. But winter species such as filleted fish are not worth considering during the festive season. For the big spenders, Eastern rock lobster is right at the top end of the market and range from $99-$100 a kilo.

"By. Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia. Late last year a body building champion and personal trainer from Christchurch, New Zealand, was caught smuggling illegal recreational drugs from overseas. Stephen Michael Raymond Orton, who won the title of world champion at the National Amateur Bodybuilders Association in Italy in June 2013, admitted to importing nearly $100,000 worth of an ecstacy mimic from China. On Thursday he was due to appear in Christchurch District Court for sentencing, according to stuff.co.nz. His lawyer was expected to seek a discharge without conviction. Scroll down for video. Steve Orton was caught smuggling almost $100,000 worth of illegal drugs into New Zealand last year. This is so he would still be able to travel internationally for bodybuilding competitions, something that may be hindered if he were to spend time behind bars. In May he pleaded guilty to two charges of importing the Class C drugs, which is said to have been about 700 grams of methylone. According to court files seen by The Press, the 24-year-old was arrested after he admitted to receiving a number of packages which had been intercepted at Auckland Airport.

"(CNN) -- Five years. Sixty-two episodes. One big, presumably bloody finale. Hundreds of possible ways it could end. With ""Breaking Bad"" careening toward a climax Sunday night, fans of the AMC show -- newly anointed by Emmy voters as the best drama on TV -- are feverishly doing the plot-resolution math. The Internet is buzzing with potential clues, predictions and crazy theories as viewers debate the most fitting way to send teacher-turned-drug-lord Walter White into the Albuquerque sunset. Which characters will survive? Will Walt die, and how? Who is the vial of ricin, and the machine gun in his trunk, meant for? What will become of wife Skyler, son Walt Jr., sister-in-law Marie and -- most pressing of all -- Jesse, his tormented ex-partner in crime? Cryptic comments by Vince Gilligan, the show's creator, have only stoked the speculation. ""We worked long and hard to ensure that... the very last episode â€” would satisfy an audience,"" he told Entertainment Weekly. ""I am guardedly optimistic that we have achieved just that. And furthermore, trying to be as coy as possible, trying to give away as little as possible, I feel like this ending represents on some level, however small, something of a victory for Walter White. ""Read into that what you will. And try to be as open-minded as possible when you watch this episode, because it may not indeed feel like a victory. Or maybe it will."" Got that? Only Gilligan, his actors and crew know for sure how the show will end its run. But that hasn't stopped the rest of us from trying to guess. Here are five theories:. Hail the returning conqueror. This one is the most obvious, and therefore the most unlikely. Walt shows up at Uncle Jack's compound, seeking his stolen money, and somehow takes out Jack, Todd and the rest of the neo-Nazi thugs -- either with a surprise hail of bullets or a stealthy dose of poison. In the process, he also frees Jesse, who either is a) so grateful to be sprung from his hellish existence as a meth-cook slave that he walks away, or b) so angry that he kills Walt right there, extracting a measure of revenge on the ""mentor"" who ruined his life. Bryan Cranston: Man of the moment. Shakespearean tragedy. Despite its comic moments, ""Breaking Bad"" at its heart is an epic tragedy with a high body count. In some ways it would be true to the show's dark heart if things end bleakly for almost everyone: Walt's attack on Uncle Jack goes wrong, he and Jesse are killed and Skyler goes to prison or commits suicide, orphaning Walt Jr. and Holly and leaving Lydia free to go on supplying Europe with crystal meth -- Walt's last, bitter legacy. Gray's frenemy. Some fans of the show think Walt got so worked up watching Elliott and Gretchen Schwartz -- whose lucrative Gray Matter pharmaceutical company may have been rightfully his -- on ""Charlie Rose"" at that bar in New Hampshire that he's been jolted into seeking some long-repressed revenge. He sure bolted from the bar in a huff. But why would he need an automatic weapon to confront a couple of scientists? Besides, such a quest would distract from bigger potential showdowns with other characters. Photos: Memorable scenes from 'Breaking Bad' Expect the unexpected.

"Bali, Indonesia (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama met Friday with his Indonesian counterpart in Bali as he prepares to conclude an eight-day trip to the Asia-Pacific region. The meeting with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono came ahead of Obama's participation in the East Asia Summit, a first for a U.S. president, according to the White House. The summit serves as a forum for the region -- which accounts for more than half of the world's gross domestic product -- to create dialogue on issues relating to politics, security and the economy. Obama is expected to meet Saturday with Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra before the East Asia Summit session, after which he will depart for home. As part of their talks Friday, Yudhoyono and Obama announced a $600 million deal through the Millennium Challenge Corporation ""to support environmentally sustainable economic development through clean energy projects and sustainable landscapes projects, community-based nutrition programs, and procurement modernization,"" according to the White House. The leaders also reaffirmed their partnership and ""commitment to strengthen democracy and human rights in their own societies."" Earlier Friday, Obama took part in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economic summit and hailed an airplane sales deal between Boeing and an Indonesian airline. Obama held bilateral talks with India, the Philippines and Malaysia before the ASEAN meeting. He also attended a gala dinner for East Asian leaders Friday wearing a traditional Indonesian shirt. Meanwhile, ASEAN leaders agreed that Myanmar can chair the regional bloc in 2014, amid some signs of reform. Some critics say it is still too early to award the high-profile role to Myanmar, where 600 to 1,000 political prisoners are believed to remain behind bars. Coinciding with the agreement, Obama announced that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton plans to visit Myanmar next month on a trip that could signal a major change in relations between the two countries. He made the announcement after talking with pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Clinton's trip is an indication that Myanmar, also known as Burma, has made some progress toward democracy and that the time could be right to forge a new relationship between the nations, the White House said. The Asian leg of Obama's trip follows two days in Australia, where he declared that the United States will increase its military presence and expand its role in shaping the Asia-Pacific region. ""Our enduring interests in the region demand our enduring presence in this region,"" Obama told the Australian Parliament. ""The United States is a Pacific power, and we are here to stay."" He announced an agreement with Australia on Wednesday that will expand military cooperation between the longtime allies and boost America's presence in the region.

"Slovyansk, Ukraine (CNN) -- In a forest of pines to the east of Slovyansk, Prapor and his seventy men were digging in Thursday. A man in his late-fifties with a magnificent beard and four different weapons, Prapor freely admitted he was not a local. But he was here -- he said -- to resist the ""Ukrainian fascists"" in Krasny Liman, a nearby town just recaptured by government forces. He was dismissive of the group that had fled Krasny -- ""Cossacks,"" he sneered. He had already lost seven men, but his fighters were the bravest. They would not run away. Meeting Prapor was revealing in several ways. Pro-Russian separatists working in eastern Ukraine are better organized, better armed (Prapor's group had a truck-mounted anti-aircraft gun that was clearly working), and more of them appear to come from beyond Ukraine. And they are building a maze of roadblocks and defensive positions across the region. But a few kilometers beyond, in rolling countryside under a hot sun, a very different group was setting up camp: a substantial force of Ukrainian paratroopers, with armored personnel carriers and artillery. Above, a reconnaissance plane drifted in loops. Both sides look -- at least militarily -- more competent than they did a few weeks ago. Checkpoints used to be few and far between. Now there is a maze of them -- more separatist than Ukrainian -- dotted across both the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The insignia of the ""Vostok Battalion"" -- a group that includes both Russian and local fighters -- is common at the roadblocks that have sprung up on the main roads leading into Donetsk. A few weeks ago, we watched the bedraggled remnants of the Ukrainian army's 25th Division surrounded and harangued by locals near Kramatorsk. Now there is a sense of purpose among the units newly deployed, and a greater readiness to use heavy armor. Throughout an extensive tour of the Slovyansk area, the crump of artillery and boom of tankfire sounded periodically. But the targeting is sometimes puzzling. Krasny Liman is a town of some 20,000 people and a major railway junction. But one of its two hospitals is in ruins, struck repeatedly by what appeared to have been mortars or shells. There was also evidence of strafing from the air. A tearful nurse approached us, saying that whoever had done this was not human. She -- and others -- thought Ukrainian forces were responsible, but they could not be sure. Patients had been evacuated, but one middle-aged man sat listlessly on a bench outside. He had nowhere to go, he told us; a doctor came past once a day to give him an injection. The new mayor, installed Thursday as Kiev's local appointee, said he would investigate the bombing of the hospital. But for the government, recovering Krasny Liman is a rare victory -- and judging by the number of troops installed around the town, one it intends to protect. Now Ukrainian armor seems intent on squeezing separatist positions closer to Slovyansk. It seems like eastern Ukraine is half-way through a game of chess, pieces scattered across the board in threatening positions, with neither black nor white close to checkmate. Civilians, whatever their allegiance, are suffering the consequences. The main highway that links Slovyansk and the Russian border, a route crowded with trucks just a few weeks ago, is desert</s>","It seems like eastern Ukraine is half-way through a game of chess, writes CNN's Tim Lister.

"By. Jill Reilly. A New York teenager has opened the world's first sneaker pawnshop where other youngsters can deposit their valuable trainers in return for cash. The shop, which is the brainchild of Chase Reed, 16, from Harlem, stocks high-end designer models which are often high value because they are limited edition. Chase came up with the idea for Sneaker Pawn after asking his father, Troy, if he could borrow $50 (£29) just days after being bought a pair of expensive trainers. A New York teenager has opened the world's first sneaker pawnshop where other youngsters can deposit their valuable trainers in return for cash. Pictured: Nike Air Yeezys designed in collaboration with the rapper Kanye West. Troy told the New York Post: 'I was like, ‘Are you serious?’ I’m holding these sneakers until I get my $50 back.' The pair then opened the store - Chase sold his own 200-strong collection of trainers to raise funds for the opening. Troy works in the shop during school hours, but the 10th grader works there after school and at weekends. Shoes are only admitted once they have passed the smell test and owners are then given cash - they can redeem their sneakers at a later date or allow them to be sold. Before any sale owners have first refusal and receive 80 per cent of the proceeds if they decide for it to go ahead. Customers usually borrow around $100 per pair of lightly-worn trainers, although one was lent thousands of dollars after taking in a pair of sought-after Nike LeBron Crown Jewels and two pairs of Nike Air Jordans. They must repay the loan at a rate of 20 per cent. The shop, which is the brainchild of Chase Reed, 16, from Harlem, stocks high-end designer models which are often high value because they are limited edition (file photo) Mr Reed said: 'Young kids don’t have jewellery. They don’t have cars. But what they do have is the thousands of dollars worth of sneakers in their house. 'After we evaluate them, we’ll give the kid, say, $100 for the sneakers. If he wants them back, he’ll pay the $100, plus $20 for storing the sneakers.' The pair said customers have pawned trainers for reasons indulging funeral costs, and two teenage girls who wanted cash to buy prom dresses. The owner of the LeBron Crown Jewels used the money to move to the Bronx from Brooklyn. In recent years limited edition and exclusive trainers have become big business. A pair of Air Jordan 1s that were. autographed by the basketball great himself once sold at auction for. $60,000 - so Kanye West is a long way off entering the'most expensive. sneaker hall of fame'.

"A trial opened in Philadelphia Tuesday for a woman accused of beating to death her 10-year-old special-needs stepdaughter, whom the prosecution say the stepmother hated and wanted dead. Charlenni Ferreira was rushed to the hospital in October 2009, just days before her 11th birthday, after she was found unresponsive in her parents' home on C Street. She died a short time later. Doctors uncovered that the girl's lungs had collapsed due to an untreated infection caused by multiple broken ribs. Shocking abuse: Margaret Garabito (left), 48, is facing murder and child abuse charges in the 2009 death of her stepdaughter, Charlenni Ferreira (right), who succumbed to an infection caused by broken ribs. Charlenni's other injuries suggesting long-term physical and sexual abuse included a seven-inch head wound hidden from view by a weave, a broken hipbone, marks and bruises all over her body, and vaginal and anal scaring. The child's father, Domingo Ferreira, and her stepmother, Margaret Garabito, were charged with murder, endangering the welfare of a child and additional counts. In his opening statement, prosecutor Andrew Notaristefano told the jury at Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Tuesday that Garabito, 48, has admitted to hitting her stepdaughter on the head with a broom, which resulted in a skull fracture and brain damage, reported Philly.com. Too late: The child's father, Domingo Ferreira, 53, was also charged but he committed suicide in jail. 'She hated this child and she wanted this child dead and out of her life,' said Notaristefano. Garabito's defense attorney, J. Michael Farrell, argued that his client was only guilty of manslaughter for failing to stop her husband from beating and molesting his daughter. Ferreira is expected to testify that her spouse told her he would kill her and her three teenage children if she went to the police. 'My client was a victim too,' the attorney told the jury panel Tuesday. Domingo Ferreira, 53, committed suicide in jail three days after his arrest. Also on Tuesday, the jurors were shown graphic photographs of Charlenni’s gaping 7-by-4-inch head wound, which the prosecution said her stepmother concealed for a year by stuffing it with cotton and pinning a hairpiece over it. Assistant Medical Examiner Marlon Osborne testified in court that countless bobby pins and clips holding the weave in place were embedded in the child's badly scarred, almost entirely bald scalp. Sitting next to her attorney, Garabito appeared shaken to see the graphic autopsy images and was seen wiping away tears. The prosecutor said Charlenni, a native of Puerto Rico who came to live with her father and his new family in Philadelphia in 2005, sustained about three years of continuous abuse, beginning in the fall of 2006 and ending the day she died October 21, 2009. When Domingo Ferreira went to Puerto Rico for a month in the fall of 2009, the prosecutor said his wife subjected her stepdaughter to repeated beatings, striking her with a metal broom handle and sticks. Charlenni was found unresponsive in her parents' home on C Street in Philadelphia in October 2009. Describing the 10-year-old child as 'broken from head to toe,' Notaristefano told the jury that every time her stepmother broke another one of her ribs, Charlenni suffered from internal bleeding, which eventually resulted in fluid buildup that sparked an infection.

"London (CNN) -- The United States, the European Union and Japan have filed a trade case over China's export restrictions on rare earth minerals that are crucial for the production of many high-tech devices. What are rare earth minerals? Rare earths are 17 minerals with magnetic and conductive properties that are used in most of today's electronic devices, including flat-screen televisions, smart phones, hybrid cars and weapons. The minerals include cerium, neodymium, dysprosium, tungsten and molybdenum. Tungsten, for example, is used in electronics, automotive, aerospace and medical technologies. China produces 91% of the world's tungsten. Molybdenum is a metallic element used for filaments in light bulbs. China produces 36% of the world's molybdenum. They are not actually ""rare,"" and can be found in other countries -- including the U.S. -- but they are difficult to mine safely. About a third of the world's rare earth deposits are in China but the country controls around 97% of production, in part due to its lower labor costs and less stringent environmental regulations. Rare earth minerals' importance and limited supplies have created friction between China and the U.S., among other countries, for years. What is the issue? China's dominance in the industry has led to suggestions it can be used as part of a trade war with the U.S. and Europe. In 2010, a report commissioned by the U.S. Congress found China's dominant position in production could have major implications for the U.S. Department of Defense. In June that year, China tightened export restrictions on the materials by raising export taxes and reducing the amount it can send overseas. It reduced the quota for Chinese-owned companies by 32% but by 54% for companies with foreign investment. In December, it further reduced quotas. It also temporarily halted shipments of rare earths to Japan, prompting a sharp spike in prices of the minerals. What has happened now? The trade case by the U.S, European Union and Japan accuses China of increasing prices outside China while lowering them within the country, creating unfair advantages. The U.S. also accuses China of hoarding the minerals for its own use. The U.S. aims to pressure China to lift export limits. China has defended its actions by saying they are in line with World Trade Organization regulations, and that the restrictions are due to environmental concerns. Why does it matter? Rare earths minerals are hugely important to the technology industry, and the U.S. and the European Union are fierce in their language against China. According to a European Commission statement, restrictions ""violate international trade rules"" and hurt producers of car components and computers, among other industries. The EU said it has raised the issue with China repeatedly over the past years without success. U.S. president Barack Obama said: ""We have got to take control of our energy future and we can't let that energy industry take root in some other country because they were allowed to break the rules."" What will happen next? The European Union, U.S. and Japan are all making requests for consultations with the Chinese, as part of the WTO dispute process.

So, ladies, if you're fed up of wobbling along on perilously high heels, grab your chance to ditch them while you can – because flats are finally in vogue. Designers are swapping stilettos and platform heels for more comfortable footwear, according to industry insiders. Changing fashions: Industry insiders say designers are swapping stilettos and platform heels for flats. And the catwalk trend has already reached the high street, where sales of flats and trainers have rocketed over the past few months. The likes of Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn were seen sporting Burberry's micro-low wedges and Christopher Kane's flat shiny boots during London Fashion Week. Cool Britannia: Roberto Cavalli said the influence is coming from London. And at his Milan fashion show, Italian designer Roberto Cavalli said: 'Women are wearing trainers now and lower heels. It's the street influence. It's cool and it's all coming from London.' At Kurt Geiger, lower heels now account for about 60 per cent of sales, while at Debenhams sales of flat or low-heeled shoes have risen by 25 per cent in the past six months. Sales of comfortable shoes at John Lewis have doubled in the past year, and last week's figures were up by 153 per cent on the same period in 2011. Rebecca Farrar-Hockley, creative director at Kurt Geiger, said: 'There's definitely a radical shift towards lower heels. Sneakers are really on trend. 'Sneakers are really on trend. Girls are getting used to being able to run about and I don't think they are going back to the big high heels.' Helen Attwood, footwear buying manager for Selfridges, added: 'It's a revolution. Out of all our footwear categories we are repeating orders mostly on flats and trainers. They are selling out across every price point.' Kate Ormrod, a fashion analyst at retail analyst Verdict, said the Royal Wedding may have influenced the new trend. She said: 'Low platforms and wedges and nude finishes are on trend, particularly due to high interest in the styles worn by the Duchess of Cambridge. 'There has been a move towards more comfortable styles and catwalk trends are quicker to filter down to the high street.' Trend-setters: The shift is partly down to the likes of Cara Delevingne being seen out and about in trainers. Even Victoria Beckham, who is often seen pioneering the latest towering heels, was photographed in New York this winter wearing monk-strap flat shoes. She also dressed the models in her spring 13 catwalk show in Manolo Blahnik monks. And students at the London College of Fashion are also cottoning on to the new craze with designs for their degree projects. According to course leader Sue Sanders, students are increasingly ditching heels for flat designs with'strappy, complicated constructions'. Francesca Burns, fashion editor of Vogue magazine, told the Sunday Times said the trend of teaming 'casual trainers with posh frocks'began last year and had been adopted by well-known figures such as Agyness Deyn, the model, and Kristen Stewart, the actress.

"(Health.com) -- When Megan Kenny was five years old, she began to exhibit a strange and troubling symptom: Every time she stood up for more than two minutes, she collapsed. The episodes were particularly bad after Megan had been sitting or lying down for prolonged stretches, such as when she woke up in the morning or walked between classes at school. ""Church was always a disaster,"" recalls Mary Kenny, Megan's mother. After sitting or kneeling for a time, Megan would stand up with the congregation and invariably fall down. As Megan got older, other worrisome signs emerged. Her eyelids began to droop. She continued to wet the bed and suffered from constant bladder infections. And, about once a week, she experienced extreme hypoglycemic episodes -- a sudden drop in blood sugar levels -- that left her shaking and unable to function for the rest of the day. The Kennys visited a parade of doctors and specialists who considered, and ultimately ruled out, a grab bag of diagnoses: epilepsy, diabetes, cancer, liver failure, kidney failure. One time, after testing Megan for epilepsy, a neurologist observed that she appeared to have a severe form of orthostatic hypotension, a not-unusual condition in which a person's blood pressure drops suddenly upon standing or sitting up, causing the sensation known as a head rush. Health.com: Surgery saves girl's face from rare disorder. The doctor was only half right. Megan did have orthostatic hypotension, but the underlying cause was a far more exotic condition that wouldn't be diagnosed until she was an adult. In the meantime, she had to cope with having blood pressure that could dive from a relatively normal 110/70 when she was lying down to 50/30 upon standing. ""I've seen dead people with higher blood pressure,"" one nurse told her. A family affair. It was clear from the first minute of her life that Megan wasn't in good health. She was a small baby, barely five pounds, in a family that had a history of strapping, nine-pound newborns, and she immediately required oxygen for respiratory distress. ""She was literally blue,"" Mary remembers. Later, as an infant, Megan's sucking reflux was so poor that her mother wasn't able to nurse her. Orthopedists said her motor coordination was below average and referred her for physical therapy. When Megan was eight years old, her brother, Brendan, was born. As he grew up, he too would develop symptoms similar to hers, suggesting the mysterious condition had a genetic component. Megan's parents continued visiting doctors, seeking explanations for what ailed the two siblings. While some people get the occasional head rush or dizzy spell, Megan and Brendan experienced the sensation almost constantly. ""Mostly it was a feeling as if you're going to black out, like walking through life with permanent black spots,"" Megan says. Megan learned how to compensate for the strange spells. At school, if she had to climb a flight of stairs to get to a class, she'd sit on the landing to regain her composure or lean over and pretend to tie her shoes. She even played softball throughout high school, although she needed a teammate to run the bases for her. Health.com: Doctors induce 5-month coma to save woman's life.

The pair left the Ruby Blue bar when Nimmala allegedly become angry and Ms Sultana, whom he had met on online dating website Zoosk, told him she was going home. As she walked to Charing Cross Underground station, Nimmala is accused of snatching her white Blackberry phone and running off with it. Helen Thomas, prosecuting, said: 'This case is about a first date that goes badly wrong. 'Ms Sultana informed to defendant that she didn’t have any money with her and that she had assumed that he would be paying for the evening. 'At that point the defendant became angry and so their evening together came to an abrupt close.' The couple then made their way to Charing Cross station with Nimmala allegedly badgering his date for her share of the cash on the way. Ms Thomas said: 'Mr Nimmala kept saying. to her that he wanted the £25 - her share of what he had spent on the. evening- and Ms Sultana kept saying that she didn’t have any money.' Hearing: Nimmala denied one count of theft at Southwark Crown Court. The court heard that when Ms Sultana took her phone from her bag, Nimmala 'grabbed it' and ran. 'Ms Sultana screamed after the defendant and ran after him,' said Ms Thomas. First date: Kishore Nimmala is accused of stealing Fakhara Sultana's mobile phone after a date at the Ruby Blue bar in Leicester Square, pictured. Two. police officers, who were on Charing Cross Road, joined the chase and. caught up with Nimmala on St Martin’s Lane before they witnessed him. throw the phone away. 'When asked why he ran away the defendant said ""she took my money"" adding ""I took her phone"",' Ms Thomas told jurors. In police interview Nimmala told officers that he had spent £54 and he 'wanted her to pay her share'. 'He claimed that she was trying to cheat him and when she got her phone out he took it thinking that she would give him her share of the evening,' Ms Thomas said. 'The prosecution case is that the defendant was fed up having shelled out money on a date that was going nowhere and he decided to teach Fakhara Sultana a lesson by stealing her mobile phone out of spite and causing her maximum inconvenience in doing so.' The court heard that Nimmala does not deny taking the phone without permission, but that the issue is whether or not he did so dishonestly and with the intention to permanently deprive her of the device.

"By. Dan Bloom. A top Olympic official has slammed preparations for the 2016 Games in Rio saying they are the 'worst that I've experienced'. John Coates, vice president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), made the damning public attack after an unprecedented task force was set up to deliver the Games on time. IOC staff will be parachuted into Brazil's second-largest city to speed up construction delays which have been described as worse than the Athens Games in 2004. Work in progress: The Olympic Park in Rio pictured last month. The IOC said there are unprecedented delays. A long way to go: The fabric of Rio's Olympic Stadium is largely completed, but despite this the IOC has said the situation is worse than in Athens in 2004, with work held up by strikes and bureaucracy. Mr Coates told delegates today at an Olympic forum that preparations were still in chaos, with strikes delaying construction and one crucial department employing just two people. Dwellers of the city's famous favelas (slums) have taken to the streets in increasingly violent protests as tensions rise over the multi-billion dollar works, which will destroy many of their homes. Thousands of troops were deployed to Rio's slums in February to wrest. them back from the control of drug gangs and criminals. FIFA has also warned Brazil over its drastically late preparations for the football World Cup, whose group stages start in just six weeks. Dire: John Coates warned there is no plan B. But Mr Coates warned there was no 'plan B' to find another host for the Olympics, and they would have to be held in Rio regardless. The Australian, 63, told delegates in Sydney construction delays were worse than in the 2004 Athens Games, where the Olympic stadium was finished just two months before the opening ceremony. He added infrastructure was significantly behind schedule and water quality was a major concern. 'In Athens, we were dealing with one government and some city responsibilities,' he said. 'Here, there's three. 'There is bureaucracy, there is little. coordination between the federal, the state government and the city -. which is responsible for a lot of the construction. 'The flow of funds. from the federal government is not happening quickly enough. We think we. need to help facilitate tha. 'And. this is against a city that's got social issues that also have to be. addressed; a country that's also trying to deal with the FIFA World Cup. coming up in a few months. 'It's the worst that I've experienced.' The. first Games in South America have been plagued by delays, rising costs. and poor communication between the Brazilian government and organisers,. prompting criticism from sports federations. Redevelopment: Last week the Perimetral overpass was demolished as part of Rio's Porto Maravilha (Marvelous Port) urbanisation project ahead of the Olympics. Mr Coates said infrastructure was not on track. Workers: Builders on strike outside the Olympic Park earlier this month. Employees have clashed with guards. Earlier this month the IOC set up its task force, just one of a series of measures to kick-start the lagging preparations. They also include employing extra monitors and sending project managers and teams of experts. 'The. IOC has adopted a more hands-on role,' Mr Coates said. 'it is. unprecedented for the IOC but there is no plan B. We are going to Rio. 'We. have become very concerned - they are not ready in many, many ways.

"Gore, Georgia (CNN) -- Duncan Shropshire stops at the edge of the treeline, where the meadow becomes a forest. His yellow linen shirt is misbuttoned and crooked, leaving the bottom of his belly slightly exposed. His 8-year-old daughter, Mia-Grace, stands a foot or so behind him, wiping her runny nose with the sleeve of her blue sweatshirt. After about a minute, she lets out a sigh of boredom. Shropshire, 51, clasps his daughter's hand and begins leading her into the Northwest Georgia forest. ""This is where your ancestors are buried, back here,"" Shropshire says. ""C'mon, I'll show you."" And with a loving tug, Duncan Shropshire shares with his daughter a key piece of their family's history. Still holding hands, the pair weaves through the maze of thin pines, stepping over fallen oaks and basketball-sized sinkholes. Mia-Grace stays silent while her father seems singularly focused on moving forward. After five minutes, they reach a large clearing where rows of fist-sized rocks bulge out of the ground. Each rock sits atop small depressions in the ground. ""You see those humps in the ground?"" Shropshire asks. ""Uh-huh,"" Mia-Grace replies. ""Those are rows of graves. They're stacked like spoons here,"" Shropshire says. ""There was a lot of people here. People of the 1800s are buried here. And I'm trying to keep it in your memory the way granddaddy kept it in mine so it won't be forgotten."" The two crouch over a large, flat rock with the words ""Lewis Dickson, 4"" scratched into it. To the left of the marker is a row of 12 rocks. To the front, there are four other rows of stones, varying in number. ""How long did they bury our kin here?"" Mia-Grace asks. ""They started in the early 1800s, baby,"" Shropshire answers. ""They worked our people to death here. They were slaves. And probably about 1905 is when they stopped burying in this area. Your great-great-great grandfather, a (slave-owning) man named Wesley, he had five children by this slave woman, your great-great-great grandmother. She is buried over here on this side. Her name is Molly."" Mia-Grace's light green eyes get big. ""I'm worried I might step on them,"" she says. ""Oh, baby,"" Shropshire says with a laugh, ""they're gone. They're gone! They're sleeping right now, waiting for the Lord to come."" A ""rare"" and ""special"" place. The Shropshire gravesite is in the Appalachian foothills outside Gore, Georgia. About 1,000 feet from the clearing is an old, abandoned church on a dusty dirt road. Experts say that if slaves or former slaves are buried at the site, it would be a unique archeological find. ""In Appalachia, it would be extremely rare to have a black or slave graveyard,"" explained Ruth Little, co-author of ""Sticks and Stones: Three Centuries of North Carolina Gravemarkers.""

"Editor's note: John M. McCardell Jr., president emeritus at Middlebury College, is founder and president of Choose Responsibility, a nonprofit organization that seeks to engage the public in debate over the effects of the 21-year-old drinking age. John McCardell says the 21-year-old drinking age isn't preventing widespread binge drinking. (CNN) -- One year ago, a group of college and university presidents and chancellors, eventually totaling 135, issued a statement that garnered national attention. The ""Amethyst Initiative"" put a debate proposition before the public -- ""Resolved: That the 21-year-old drinking age is not working."" It offered, in much the way a grand jury performs its duties, sufficient evidence for putting the proposition to the test. It invited informed and dispassionate public debate and committed the signatory institutions to encouraging that debate. And it called on elected officials not to continue assuming that, after 25 years, the status quo could not be challenged, even improved. One year later, the drinking age debate continues, and new research reinforces the presidential impulse. Just this summer a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry revealed that, among college-age males, binge drinking is unchanged from its levels of 1979; that among non-college women it has increased by 20 percent; and that among college women it has increased by 40 percent. Remarkably, the counterintuitive conclusion drawn by the investigators, and accepted uncritically by the media, including editorials in The New York Times and The Washington Post is that the study proves that raising the drinking age to 21 has been a success. More recently, a study of binge drinking published in the Journal of the American Medical Association announced that ""despite efforts at prevention, the prevalence of binge drinking among college students is continuing to rise, and so are the harms associated with it."" Worse still, a related study has shown that habits formed at 18 die hard: ""For each year studied, a greater percentage of 21- to 24-year-olds [those who were of course once 18, 19 and 20] engaged in binge drinking and driving under the influence of alcohol."" Yet, in the face of mounting evidence that those young adults age 18 to 20 toward whom the drinking age law has been directed are routinely -- indeed in life- and health-threatening ways -- violating it, there remains a belief in the land that a minimum drinking age of 21 has been a ""success."" And elected officials are periodically reminded of a provision in the 1984 law that continues to stifle any serious public debate in our country's state legislative chambers: Any state that sets its drinking age lower than 21 forfeits 10 percent of its annual federal highway appropriation. But it's not 1984 anymore. This statement may seem obvious, but not necessarily. In 1984 Congress passed and the president signed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act. The Act, which raised the drinking age to 21 under threat of highway fund withholding, sought to address the problem of drunken driving fatalities. And indeed, that problem was serious. States that lowered their ages during the 1970s and did nothing else to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol witnessed an alarming increase in alcohol-related traffic fatalities. It was as though the driving age were lowered but no drivers education were provided. The results were predictable. Now, 25 years later, we are in a much different, and better, place.

"Two suicide bombers detonated their explosives outside a historic church in Pakistan today killing 85 people in the deadliest-ever attack on the country's Christian minority. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the bombing in the city of Peshawar, saying it would continue to target non-Muslims until the US stopped drone attacks in the country's remote tribal region. The latest drone strike came on Sunday when missiles hit a pair of compounds in the North Waziristan tribal area, killing six suspected militants, Pakistani intelligence officials said. Explosion: A Pakistani man helps an injured victim of a suicide attack at a church in Peshawar, Pakistan. Mourning: People gather at the site of suicide attack on a church in Peshawa this morning. The attack on All Saints Church, which also wounded 140 people, underlines the threat posed by the Pakistani Taliban at a time when the government is seeking a peace deal with the militants. The attack occurred as hundreds of worshippers were coming out of the church in the city's Kohati Gate district after services to get a free meal of rice. 'There were blasts and there was hell for all of us,' said Nazir John, who was at the church with at least 400 other worshippers. 'When I got my senses back, I found nothing but smoke, dust, blood and screaming people. I saw severed body parts and blood all around.' Help: A Pakistani Christian carries an injured woman on her arrival at the hospital. A relative cries after the victims of twin suicide bombings that targeted the Church are moved to a hospital. People stand beside the coffins to be used to repatriate bodies of the victims of the twin suicide bombings. A woman mourns the death of her relatives following the explosion which also injured about 140 people. Survivors wailed and hugged each other in the wake of the blasts. The white walls of the church, which first opened in the late 1800s, were pockmarked with holes caused by ball bearings or other metal objects contained in the bombs to cause maximum damage. Blood stained the floor and was splashed on the walls. Plates filled with rice were scattered across the ground. The attack was carried out by a pair of suicide bombers who detonated their explosives almost simultaneously. Authorities found body parts and have been trying to determine their age. The blasts killed 85 people and wounded another 140. The dead included women and children. The number of casualties from the blasts was so high that the hospital was running out of caskets for the dead and beds for the wounded, said Mian Iftikhar Hussain, a former information minister of surrounding Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province who was on the scene. Protest: Members of the Pakistani Christian minority burn tyres as they shout slogans against the bombing. Grief: Relatives clutch the coffins of their loved ones following the explosion today. Hospitals have run out of caskets for the dead and beds for the wounded. Tragedy: Coffins are lined up near the church as relatives flock to the scene to mourn their dead.

"(CNN) -- An Ohio inmate, convicted of killing and dismembering a 22-year-old woman in 1991, was executed Tuesday using a new, untested one-drug method of lethal injection, state officials said. Kenneth Biros, 51, was pronounced dead at 11:47 a.m. at a prison in Lucasville, Ohio, the state attorney general's office said in a written statement. His last words, according to Department of Rehabilitation and Correction spokeswoman Julie Walburn, were: ""Sorry from the bottom of my heart. I want to thank all of my family and friends for my prayers and who supported and believed in me. ""My father, now I'm being paroled to heaven,"" Biros said, according to Walburn. ""I will now spend all of my holidays with my lord and savior, Jesus Christ. Peace be with you all. Amen."" Biros' execution is the first in Ohio since September, when the governor and federal courts halted capital punishment in the state after a botched attempt to execute another prisoner, Romell Broom. The prison staff could not find a suitable vein for the injections. The one-drug method had never been tried on a U.S. death row inmate. It relies on a single dose of sodium thiopental injected into a vein. A separate two-drug muscle injection was available as a backup, officials said. The one-drug method has been used to euthanize animals. The same drug, sodium thiopental, at a much lower dosage, is the first ingredient in the three-drug method previously used in Ohio, as well as in all but one of the other 34 states that allow the death penalty. Some capital punishment opponents claim the sodium thiopental, which renders the prisoner unconscious, can wear off too quickly, and that some prisoners would actually be awake and able to feel pain as the procedure continues. Biros' execution was initially scheduled for 10 a.m., but preparations were delayed as officials waited for a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court on Biros' request for a stay, Walburn said. The high court without comment denied the request about 10 a.m., and ""we were about an hour behind"" in preparations, she said. The execution began around 11 a.m. Biros died about 10 minutes after the drugs began to flow, she said, but he was not officially pronounced dead until later. Biros, 51, was convicted of killing Tami Engstrom near the town of Warren. He met the woman at a bar and offered to drive her home, and later admitted robbing and attempting to rape her. Prosecutors said Biros dismembered Engstrom and spread her body parts around northeast Ohio and neighboring Pennsylvania. The crime was ""particularly heinous, with 91 pre-mortem wounds,"" according to the clemency report. Biros claimed he acted in a fit of drunken rage. He was involved in litigation challenging the three-drug method and received a stay of execution in 2007 because of his involvement in the suit, according to minutes of a November parole board meeting posted on the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections' Web site. His attorney, Timothy Sweeney, had also objected to the one-drug method, saying it was unconstitutional. Sweeney wrote in an appeal that use of the one-drug method would amount to ""human experimentation, pure and simple."" But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month denied Biros' request for a stay, concluding that since Ohio had announced it would change its protocol and rely on the one-drug method, Biros' argument regarding the three-</s>","Kenneth Biros was convicted of killing and dismembering a 22-year-old woman in 1991.

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration pushed forward Sunday on a new path toward military action in Syria, urging Congress to support the president's call. Tests found signatures of sarin gas in blood and hair samples collected from the Damascus site of an alleged chemical weapons attack, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union. The samples were collected separately from a United Nations investigation into the August 21 attack and provide further proof that the Syrian regime attacked its own people, Kerry said. With ""each day that goes by, this case is even stronger,"" he said, arguing that the United States must act. ""If you don't do it, you send a message of impunity,"" Kerry said. Iran, North Korea, and Hezbollah ""will look at the United States and say 'Nothing means anything' -- that's what's at stake here,"" he said. Syria denies using chemical weapons on its people and blames the rebels. Kerry called the evidence ""overwhelming"" Sunday, and the Arab League issued a statement blaming the Syrian government for the attack. But the United Nations argued that world leaders should wait until U.N. investigators determine whether chemical weapons were used. 'Red line' debate: Are chemical weapons worse? ""The U.N. mission is uniquely capable of establishing in an impartial and credible manner the facts of any use of chemical weapons,"" Martin Nesirky, spokesman for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said repeatedly at a news conference. So when will the results be ready? The U.N. won't give a timeline, Nesirky said. ""It's being done as fast as it is possible to do within the scientific constraints."" Samples will be delivered to laboratories Monday, he said. The investigation involves a strict chain of custody and clear guidelines, he said, adding that two Syrian government officials monitored the process. But even when it's done, the U.N. will only say whether chemical weapons were used -- not who was responsible. Obama's last-minute Syria switch. U.S. military action appeared imminent until Saturday, when Obama announced he would first seek lawmakers' approval. Obama made a last-minute decision Friday evening to seek congressional authorization before any military action, senior administration officials told reporters. ""While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,"" Obama said Saturday. The 1973 War Powers Act technically allows him to strike without such approval. Lawmakers officially come back from recess on September 9. But some members of Congress arrived on Capitol Hill Sunday for a classified briefing on Syria with White House, State Department and Pentagon officials. Many of them said they remained skeptical and undecided about how to respond to the August 21 purported chemical weapons attack that U.S. officials have said killed more than 1,000 people in Syrian rebel strongholds. ""There was a great deal of skepticism in the room about the utility, effectiveness and support that we would have for the kind of strike that the president has proposed,"" said Rep. Jim Himes, D-Connecticut. ""There's not a lot of skepticism, frankly, about whether or not this was an attack carried out by the Syrian regime. While nobody would say that it's been proven, the vast bulk of the evidence suggests that this was an attack carried out by the Assad regime."" Sen.

"Dublin, Ireland (CNN) -- Thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Dublin on Saturday to remember a woman who died after being refused an abortion and to demand a change to the country's laws. Savita Halappanavar, 31, went into a hospital on October 21 complaining of back pain. She was 17 weeks pregnant at the time. The doctors who examined her told her she was having a miscarriage but denied her an abortion even though she was in extreme pain, her husband has said. Halappanavar died of septicemia, or a blood infection, at the hospital. Chanting ""never again, never again"" protesters marched to government buildings and held a candlelit vigil in Dublin. Vigils were also held other cities, including Galway, where Halappanavar died, and outside the Irish Embassy in London. ""I'm here today to stand up for women's rights. And I think the government should legislate and stop messing around,"" said Patrick O'Neill, a protester. Abortions laws in Ireland are strict and terminations can only carried out in exceptional circumstances. Twenty years ago, the Irish Supreme Court ruled abortions are allowed when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. But the ruling was never been enacted into law, meaning there is little clarity for doctors or patients as to when an abortion can and can't take place. It is this Supreme Court ruling that some Irish people now want made into law. Gerry Adams, leader of Ireland's Sinn Fein political party, has said it's time for the government to legislate for abortion in certain medical cases. Other politicians have called called for an investigation into Halappanavar's death. Her death is ""particularly tragic and harrowing, and shocking to all concerned,"" said Irish opposition lawmaker Micheal Martin. He has called for an independent inquiry into the case ""with personnel from outside the country to participate on such a panel of inquiry."" The Irish government needs to ""establish the full circumstances"" of her death, he said. The government has said it will launch an investigation, but details, including who will lead it, remain elusive. The government has said it will include the Halappanavar family in the inquiry.

"DNA tests have confirmed that a daughter and an ex-wife of the head of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are indeed being held by Lebanese authorities. There have been conflicting reports about the identity of the woman, with an Iraqi official denying on Wednesday she was al-Baghdadi's ex wife. But a Lebanese interior minister confirmed today that the woman and child who were detained about 10 days ago in northern Lebanon travelling with a fake ID are in fact the ex wife and daughter of the terrorist leader. Islamic State (IS) group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addresses worshippers at a mosque in Mosul, after he established a self-declared caliphate across Iraq and Syria on July 5, 2014. The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi, was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday. He said DNA tests showed that the girl was Baghdadi's child. 'Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,' he said. 'Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child,' Mashnuq added. 'We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is his (Baghdadi's) daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,' the minister said. The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi (pictured), was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday. He gave no details on Dulaimi's nationality, but a security source said she was believed to be Iraqi. Mashnuq offered no further information about her current husband, although he said investigations showed the woman had ties to extremists in Lebanon. Dulaimi's children were at a children's care centre while she was being interrogated, he said. Mashnuq also confirmed the arrest of the wife of Anas Sharkas, a leader in Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front. Dulaimi was among a group of female prisoners released from Syrian jails in March, in exchange for 13 nuns from the ancient town of Maalula held by Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front. The Islamic State (IS) group has yet to comment publicly on Dulaimi's detention, but Al-Nusra, despite a feud with Baghdadi's group, issued a statement of condemnation. It described her as'sister Saja al-Dulaimi' and said the arrest of women and children was evidence of the 'weakness' of the Lebanese state. Sources said the detention of Dulaimi and Sharkas's wife could help the Lebanese as they struggle to negotiate the release of 27 members of the security forces held by jihadists from IS and Al-Nusra.

The meeting was arranged through the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Jessica’s final wish was to meet her ‘hero’. ‘Robin Williams was her hero,’ Mark Cole told WFMY. ‘She was a huge fan and especially Ms. Doubtfire.’ Originally Jessica was supposed to travel to California to meet the actor on set, but her condition deteriorated and she was no longer fit to travel. 'In 2004, it became apparent that there was nothing doctors could do to reverse the process with the tumor growing,' said her father. The meeting in 2004 was arranged through the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Jessica's final wish had been to meet her 'hero' When the kind-hearted actor was informed about Jessica's condition he chartered a private plane to visit her at home the very next day. 'She was a little disoriented at that point with extra fluid on her brain, it was out of place for her also seeing Robin Williams walk into our home. She was confused when he first came in. Then he started his Mrs. Doubtfire imitation and then she figured it out pretty quickly.' The pair spent the day playing cards and watching football. ‘He acted like he had known her forever,’ said Mark Cole. ‘He was a lot of fun to be with.’ Jessica passed away on December 14, 2004.

Kravit met Williams at an event and asked him for autographed items for their fund-raising efforts.

"(CNN) -- In the dark of night, U.S. helicopters approached a high-walled compound in Pakistan on a mission to capture or kill one of the world's most notorious terrorist leaders. Less than 40 minutes later -- early Monday morning in Pakistan -- Osama bin Laden was dead, along with four others inside the complex, and the U.S. forces departed with the slain al Qaeda leader's body to fulfill a vow that originated shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. And as he announced the raid at the White House Sunday night, U.S. President Barack Obama called bin Laden's death ""the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al Qaeda."" One senior administration official called the investigation a ""team effort"" and a ""model of really seamless cooperation"" across agencies. This official and others briefed reporters on further details about the assault on the compound, which they believe was built five years ago for the specific purpose of hiding bin Laden -- known by the code name ""Geronimo,"" a U.S. official said. A senior administration official said later that ""Geronimo"" was code for the act of capturing or killing bin Laden, not the man himself. The compound is in Abbottabad, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. The city sits in a mountainous region that is not heavily populated. Many of the residents are army personnel. While senior administration officials would not offer a breakdown of the U.S. mission's composition, a senior defense official said U.S. Navy SEALs were involved. After years of intelligence work and months of following a specific lead, they traced a courier linked to bin Laden to the compound in Abbottabad, the officials said. When first built, the compound was secluded and reachable by only a dirt road, the officials said. In recent years, more residences built up around it, but it remained by far the largest and most heavily secured property in the area, they said. The mission ordered Friday by Obama found outer walls up to 18 feet tall topped with barbed wire, with two security gates and a series of internal walls that sectioned off different portions of the compound, the senior administration officials said. The main structure was a three-story building with few windows facing the outside of the compound, and a third-floor terrace had a 7-foot privacy wall, they said. Months of intelligence work determined that the compound was custom-built to hide a high-value terrorism suspect, almost certainly bin Laden. The officials noted there was no telephone or Internet service at the dwelling, which was valued at more than $1 million, and its occupants burned their trash rather than leave it out for collection as other area residents did. Calling the U.S. operation a surgical raid, officials said it was conducted by a small team and designed to minimize collateral damage. A firefight was under way for most of the 40 minutes that U.S. Special Operations forces were in the compound, as the team encountered resistance from bin Laden and three other men, a senior defense official said. The official said the forces had to fight their way through the first floor of the three-story building, where two adult males lived. Bin Laden and his family lived on the second and third floors, and they were cleared last, with bin Laden killed in the last five or 10 minutes of the siege, the official said. One of bin Laden's wives identified his body to U.S. forces after the team made visual identification, the official said. In the end, all four of the combatants in the compound were dead, along with a woman whom one of the men used as a human shield, the officials said. Sources said bin Laden was shot in the head.

"By. Michael Zennie. The New York Police Department is on the lookout for four to five daring vandals who scaled the Brooklyn Bridge Monday night and hoisted white flags above the New York City landmark. Detectives still don't know who is responsible for the highly-organized caper that saw the American flags above the bridge taken down and replaced with Old Glory that had been bleached white. The NYPD is treating the prank as a serious security breach and many New Yorkers are wondering how the culprits were able to slip past the police officers and surveillance cameras unnoticed at 3.30am. Police believe that there were four or five thieves and that they worked in two teams - one for each bridge tower - to take down the flags. A video from ABC News shows NYPD officers taking down the defaced banner after scaling the bridge about 11am on Tuesday. Scroll down for video. Whitewash: This photo shows that the flags above the Brooklyn Bridge appear to have been bleached American Flags - the stars and stripes are faintly visible. No one knows why or how the flags were hoisted above the Brooklyn Bridge. Officials called it a major security breach. As the New York Post reports, however, this isn't the first time that the American flags have gone missing from the bridge - one of New York's most recognizable icons. In 2012, thieves swiped the flags from both ends of the bridge, though the story never made it to the media, bridge painter Nick Krevatas told the Post. The flags were replaced and the thieves have still never been caught. In 2004, during the Republican National Convention in New York, the flags were also stolen. NYPD officials said that they believe the vandals may have been at the top of the bridge before. They tacked aluminum covers on the lights illuminating the flags, so that no one would notice the Stars and Stripes had been taken down until daybreak. 'For. someone to go around it and go up to the tower and have right size. cover to put over the light, there's some indication of pre-operational. planning,' NYPD Deputy Commissioner John Miller said on Tuesday. EarthCam. video of the bridge shows that the first tower went dark about 3.35am. The second tower went dark seven minutes later, indicating the heist was. at least a two-person job. So far, the NYPD has no clue who is. behind the flags or why they were hoisted above the bridge - though they. don't believe it has any connection to terrorism or politics. Police promptly raised American flags back to their rightful place above the bridge - replacing the Stars and Stripes that had been stolen. It's unclear how the vandals slipped past the police officers and security cameras guarding the bridge. 'This. may be somebody's art project, or it may be an attempt at a. statement,' Miller said. Several. officers scaled the bridge and were seen lowering the flag on the. Manhattan side around 11am Tuesday as traffic inched along the bridge. The. bridge is one of the most heavily secured landmarks in the city,. constantly monitored by surveillance cameras. Police patrol cars are. also stationed at both ends of the bridge. Detectives. are reviewing security footage in an attempt to determine who put up. the white flags - and how they gained access to the span. The support towers are 273-feet tall and it's unknown how the thieves managed to climb them without anyone noticing. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams blasted the vandals who took the American flags. 'If flying a white flag atop the Brooklyn Bridge is someone’</s>",Vandals managed to slip unnoticed past police officers and surveillance cameras guarding the Brooklyn Bridge early Tuesday and install white flags.

"By. Rosie Taylor. PUBLISHED:. 11:04 EST, 26 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 11:13 EST, 26 May 2013. British buyers are snapping up entire villages in Spain for a fifth of the price of the average semi-detached home here. Property bargain-hunters are making the most of Spain's economic crisis to buy homes locals can no longer afford to keep. Most of the tiny villages have been in the hands of the same families for generations, but in many cases their inhabitants have moved away to urban areas and the houses have fallen into disrepair. Bargain: Briton Neil Christie snapped up the entire Spanish village of Arrunada for just £39,000. DIY: Mr Christie has had to completely rebuild some of the houses in his village. Ghost towns: Many of the villages in rural Spain have been abandoned after families moved away and couldn't afford to maintain the properties. Unable to afford to maintain or restore them, they are being sold at knockdown prices. Estate agents say 80 per cent are being bought by foreigners - and a third of buyers are British. Father-of-two Neil Christie bought the hamlet of Arrunada in an idyllic corner of rural north west Spain for just 45,000 euros - or £39,000. That is just a fifth of the price of the average semi-detached house in Britain, at £201,427, according to the most recent Land Registry statistics. Even after he has totally renovated the four dilapidated properties, he expects to have spent no more than £140,000 on the project. Former ITV transmission controller Mr Christie, 61, fell in love with the area while holidaying with his Peruvian wife Rosa. Scenic: Mr Christie and his wife Rosa will be able to enjoy amazing views once the main house is finished. Economic crisis: Around 80 per cent of properties like this are sold to foreign buyers as Spain struggles financially, estate agents said. The couple have moved from their former home in Cumbria and are now staying in a. nearby village where Mrs Christie works as a schoolteacher, while Mr. Christie spends his time renovating their future home. He said the work has not been a. project 'for the faint hearted' and that the main house had no roof and a. tree growing in the living room when he arrived. But he has no regrets about investing in the village. 'Apart from when I’m running out of tea bags there’s absolutely ­nothing. I miss,' he told the Sunday People. 'The work I did in England could be very stressful. I found it. difficult to relax at times. 'Here I’ve got zero pollution, fresh air and fresh water and I haven’t had to bankrupt myself to get it.' Specialist estate agents are selling the abandoned villages from £53,000 to £385,000. Buyers. tend to be middle class couples in their 50s or 60s looking for. somewhere for their retirement, said estate agent Rafael Canales. Ruins: Some of the villages are cheap to buy but would take considerable work to make habitable. In need of renovation: The village of Pena Bella is on the market for £53,000. His business partner Pepe Rodil said Spanish families were selling up because they no longer had the money to maintain the properties and because who had moved away to towns and cities saw returning to the countryside as 'a backwards step'. He said: 'Foreigners are filling. the gap. I’m happy to see villages which were falling down being. renovated. It makes me sad to see them in ruins.'

"The judge in the Casey Anthony trial has been branded by a former mistress as big a liar as Casey! Judge Perry was praised for his cool, methodical handling of the controversial Casey trial but a source close to alleged mistress Janis Williamson paints an entirely different picture. The 61-year-jurist was a cheating cad who relentlessly pursued Miss Williamson and then dumped her to protect his career, claims the source. Shocking allegations: Healthcare consultant Janis Williamson says Judge Perry is a big lair. Father-of-two Judge Perry repeatedly lied to federal investigators after she brought their relationship out into the open and slapped him with a lawsuit, The National Enquirer quotes the source as saying. 'Judge Belvin Perry is as big a lair as Casey Anthony!' the source told the National Enquirer. 'Janis told me, ""The main is a flat-out liar who tried to destroy my life. It sickens me to hear people praising him. They don't know him like I do. He's a hypocrite"".' Mr Perry began pursuing Miss Williamson when she was a deputy court administrator for Florida's Ninth Judicial Circuit in 1989, the source said. Mr Perry was a circuit judge in Florida's Osceola County at the time. The source said: 'Janis said Judge Perry kept coming into her room and flirting with her. 'They played chess together and he kept asking her to lunch. Branded a womaniser: Judge Perry is accused of seeing other women while he's cheating on his wife with Janis. Convicted liar: Casey Anthony was kept behind bars for misleading police. 'Janis told me ""I'm a white woman from the South. The last thing I'd ever consider is having an affair with a black man. But Belvin persisted and one day he gave me a $250 JVC CD player"".' When asked what she had done to deserve such a gift, according to Janis the judge allegedly answered: 'Why don't you just give me a kiss.' The alleged affair began soon after, the source said. To set up their trysts, the judge would call to say he would be dropping off or leaving notes on her door with the code letter 'J', the source said. 'Janis told me that Belvin also invited her to parties at his home with his wife LaDrean and their two children. 'She said, ""He seemed to get a thrill out of taking the risk"",' the source added. It is also claimed that Mr Perry took Janis, now 62, to his house while his wife was out of town. According to the source, Mr Perry even juggled other women while he was cheating with Williamson. 'Janis told me that a woman called his hotel room when they were at a conference together, and Belvin admitted that he was seeing her,' the source said. Mr Perry often talked about leaving his wife and children - Belvin III is a 35-year-old insurance agent and Kimberly, 31, is an investments adviser - for Miss Williamson, said the source. 'Belvin told Janis that he loved her and talked about marrying her,' said the source. 'But she told me, ""I cared about Belvin, but I never loved him"".'

He is a Major in the National Guard. The 46-year-old Iraq veteran, who lost both of her legs and suffered serious injuries to her right arm while serving in 2004, was born in Thailand and spent part of her youth in Hawaii where she graduated from McKinley High School.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard sank a Japanese fishing trawler off the coast of Alaska on Thursday, more than a year after it was swept away by a tsunami off the east coast of Japan, authorities said. The trawler capsized hours after the Coast Guard set fire to it, causing it to begin taking on water, said Petty Officer 1st Class David Mosley, a Coast Guard spokesman. The sinking of the Ryou-Un Maru brought about the end of a journey for the rust-stained ship that drifted across the Pacific Ocean as part of a giant debris field generated by a tsunami that struck Japan following a 9.0 earthquake on March 11, 2011. The Coast Guard determined the trawler posed a threat to other ships navigating the area, and had been broadcasting the unmanned, unlit vessel's location to mariners to alert them to the hazard. The U.S. Geological Survey advised the Coast Guard where the ship's sinking would have the least environmental impact. ""The potential for a pollution incident is unknown at this time, but officials have limited concerns about any biological threats due to the length of time the vessel has been at sea,"" the Coast Guard said in a statement. The Coast Guard opened fire on the Ryou-Un Maru at 1 p.m. Thursday. The ship drifted from Canadian waters into U.S. waters on Saturday, and was located about 180 miles west of the Dixon Entrance in Southeast Alaska, the Coast Guard said. The trawler was first spotted floating near British Columbia by a Canadian military air patrol, and it was then determined that it had been adrift since the tsunami, Canadian officials said last month. The Japan Coast Guard identified the owner of the vessel after being contacted by Canadian officials, who were provided the identification number on the hull.

"The drive from Tallinn to Auvere in North-Eastern Estonia was long and dark. The winter sun had yet to rise and we saw little of the outside world from our misty car windows. But as we arrived at Narva, Estonia's border with Russia, a picture began to form of the economic strength of this region. In front of us, swaths of land were being bitten into and scooped up by colossal Soviet diggers. That's because underneath this grey-brown land is a soft-brown sedimentary rock that is rich in oil. But unlike shale oil and shale gas which is drilled and often associated with fracking, oil shale is found in rocks just 30 metres underground.

It will then be burned to create electric power or processed even further to produce liquid fuel. They have so much of the stuff here -- 18 million tonnes are mined here every year -- that they are completely energy independent. Eesti Energia's CEO, Sandor Liive, tells me that around 90% of the power produced in Estonia is made of oil shale and they even have enough to provide for their neighbors.

Estonia consumes less than eight terrawats, so we are a very strong electricity exporter today."" But this is not a new industry for Estonia. Read more: Driverless cars: From Hollywood to real world. They have been squeezing rocks here for a century and, now that they're making money, companies such as Eesti Energia are investing heavily on new plants, Liive told me. ""Commercial utilization of oil shale started nearly 100 years ago. Estonia got our independence in 1918 and actually Estonia independence is very much close links with the oil shale industry, because in 1924 we already had oil plants in operation, and even gasoline was produced,"" he said. ""As you can see from here, during last three years, we have invested one billion euros here. So this is not only 100 years of history but this is actually modernization and continuous development of technology and new investments."" Read more: Spain's booming Rioja economy. During our visit here, one of their proudest achievements -- the Enefit 280 oil shale plant, which will double output of kerogen oil -- was already taking shape. But talk of new plants, more open-cast pits and more shifting of land makes environmentalist cringe. Valdur Lahtvee is one of those calling for Estonia to ditch this primitive way of mining, arguing that there are enough renewable resources in the country to have 100% power supply based on renewables. Watch more: Maastricht: The birthplace of the euro. He should know -- he used to work at Eesti Energia. Now, he's the Director of Climate and Energy Programme at Stockholm's Environment Institute. ""Oil shale is the dirtiest fuel used today in European Union. The external cost of the oil shale power is 18 euro cents, coal is about is 10 cents per kw hour, wind is 0.4 euro cents -- that gives you a picture of the ecological footprint of the oil shale used,"" he told me. Watch more: A history of defaulting on debt. ""Oil shale industry contributes approximately 4% of Estonia's GDP, but, at the same time, total national emissions it provides 90% of the hazardous waste, about 80% of the major air emissions and 70/80% of the water used</s>",Estonia is using oil shale to generate energy. Oil shale is found in rocks just 30 metres underground. Oil shale industry contributes approximately 4% of Estonia's GDP. 90% of the power produced in Estonia is made of oil shale. 18 million tonnes are mined of oil shale every year-that in Auvere in North-Eastern Estonia.</s> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad>,<pad> By.

"By. Paul Donnelley. The monsters that haunt children's nightmares have been bought vividly to life by an imaginative French photographer. The images show children battling giant, sharp-toothed creatures – but with a twist. The terrifying monsters, with sharp claws and big eyes, seem to be afraid of the children as they cower in the corners of the youngsters' bedrooms. Armed with sticks, wands and swords the eight- and nine-year-olds gain the upper-hand against the villains. Diego fights a monster with a pop gun and a rifle in his bedroom as imagined by Laure Fauvel in her Terreurs, a photographic project. Parisian photographer Laure Fauvel, 22, said: 'I wanted the children not to be victims and to fight the monsters. I wanted the monsters to fear the children.' Fauvel, who began the project in March, asked friends and family to pose for the shoot and used their own bedrooms to inject their personality into the photos. She then doctored images of real animals - such as rhinos and monkeys - to create the beasts. And she even drew from her own fear of spiders for one creepy creature. But the children showed no fear during the shoot. She added: 'I asked them to imagine a monster but because they're children it was just a game for them.'

"It is an engine whose distinctive roar can make the heart leap. The successor of the great Merlin engine, the Rolls Royce Griffon also played its part in helping to win the Second World War when it was fitted to iconic warbirds such as the Spitfire. Now three excellent examples of the type are set to go under the hammer and sell for thousands of pounds. Piston power: Auction house worker Kirsty Gardner is pictured with the. three Griffon engines which provided the power for British planes such. as the Spitfire towards the end of the Second World War and beyond. Things of beauty: Two of the giant Rolls Royce Griffon engines that will sold at auction. The type propelled later model Spitfires in the Second World War. The three 36.7 litre V12 engines were. used in Supermarine Spitfires and the four-engined post-war Avro. Shackleton - and are examples of the advanced technology which helped. achieve superiority over the Germans. Today just one Shackleton and fewer. than 60 Spitfires originally fitted with one of these engines are still. flying anywhere in the world. Iconic: The positioning of the 12 pistons in a 'V'-shape gives the Rolls Royce engine its distinctive shape. And the majority of the left-over engines were disposed of after the War - some even tipped down a mine shaft just to get rid of them. The mammoth engines were discovered in a barn in Derbyshire during a house call to see furniture and ‘some stuff in the shed’ and are expected to make more than £10,000 each. Bamfords Auctioneer Steven Iredale said: 'These extremely rare pieces of British history have been saved from destruction for more than 30 years. Maritime reconnaissance: The Griffon engines powered the Avro Shackleton, a post-war Coastal Command aircraft used for sea patrols. Nation's favourite: A Supermarine Spitfire, they type which was eventually fitted with superior Griffon engines. The Griffon was the. last in the line of V-12 aero engines to be produced by Rolls-Royce with. production ceasing in 1955. Griffon engines remain in Royal Air Force. service today with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and also power. the last remaining airworthy Avro Shackleton - which flies in South Africa. In line with Rolls-Royce. convention the Griffon was named after a bird of prey, in this case the. Griffon Vulture and was commissioned by the Fleet Air Arm as a larger,. more powerful version of the Merlin engine for use in naval aircraft. Although the Griffon was designed for naval aircraft, on 8 November 1939. N. E. Rowe of the Air Ministry suggested fitting the Griffon in a. Supermarine Spitfire and this was achieved in 1941. Spitfire XII's were. the first recipient of the Griffon, a number of subsequent Spitfires. retained Merlin power but towards the end of Spitfire production all. were powered by Griffons. Towards the end of. the war Coastal Command found a need for a new. land-based Maritime Reconnaissance aircraft culminating in.

"Reeva Steenkamp's parents rejected £21,000 of 'blood money' from Oscar Pistorius after he shot dead their daughter, a court heard on Tuesday. Barry and June Steenkamp also vowed to return 'every cent' of monthly payments - totalling £6,000 - that Pistorius has been depositing into an account since Steenkamp's death. A probation officer hired by Pistorius's legal team had earlier told the court the athlete's financial gesture was an indication of his grave remorse for taking Steenkamp's life. Scroll down for video. Oscar Pistorius leaves the High Court in Pretoria at the end of the second day of his sentencing hearing.

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said the lump sum payment, raised by the sale of the runner's car, had been immediately rejected by the family, with Mrs Steenkamp insisting she did not want ‘blood money’. Mr Nel said the couple would also not proceed with any civil action against the track star. Dup de Bruyn, a lawyer for the Steenkamps, later claimed his clients had received R6,000 (£341) a month for the last 18 months. He said the payments had now stopped and the money would be repaid. Mr De Bruyn said he approached the athlete's legal team in the weeks after the model's death to explain that her family were struggling financially because Miss Steenkamp regularly sent money to her cash-strapped parents. 'I conveyed this to Oscar Pistorius's lawyers,' Mr De Bruyn told journalists, adding that the track star began providing monthly support - a fact he was keen to keep private. The lawyer said Mr and Mrs Steenkamp were now in a position to repay the money - a total of £6,200. 'The Steenkamps don’t want any money and there will be no civil case, they want closure,' Mr De Bruyn said. Pistorius's defence team said Mr De Bruyn's version was not accurate and they would give a statement on Wednesday. Pistorius' sentence hearing is expected to finish this week.

Li Guilian, who owns Dayang Trands, pointed to the cheaper cost of labour and materials in China, which allows the country to sell affordable clothes to the US. She demanded credit for her workers, who earn between $6,300 to $9,500 a year and advised officials to 'pay attention to the performances of the U.S. athletes and not their clothes'. The method of production for the Ralph Lauren designs has caused controversy but the Chinese company director says there is no way the US could recreate the work on home ground.

Elouise Keeling, 14, collapsed with breathing problems during an Air Cadets sports day at RAF Brampton near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, on June 25. A schoolgirl cried ‘I’m going to die’ after an ambulance went to the wrong address as she had a fatal asthma attack. Paramedics were called after Elouise Keeling, 14, collapsed with breathing difficulties during an air cadets sports day at an RAF base, but she died after they went to an airfield ten miles away. Her mother Karen Keeling, 33, told an inquest yesterday of the ‘chaos’ as she waited helplessly, and that when ambulance staff did turn up, they just ‘strolled over’. Mrs Keeling had rushed to RAF Brampton, near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, on June 25 last year after her daughter phoned to say she was unwell. An ambulance was called at 7.44pm but was sent to RAF Wyton and did not arrive until 8.03pm – more than twice the response for high-priority cases. Elouise was pronounced dead an hour later. Mrs Keeling said: ‘She rang me and said, “Mum, my asthma is really bad, you need to come now”. She sounded really panicked. ‘When I got to her, her eyes were open but she was unconscious. When they arrived it was quite chaotic. ‘They seemed slow getting out of the vehicle. They just strolled over. Equipment kept failing – oxygen cylinders kept running out.’ Michael Smith, 19, the cadet who made the 999 call, told how he repeatedly asked the call handler to send the ambulance to RAF Brampton, not Wyton. He said he tried to help Elouise, adding: ‘I was trying to calm her and she was very panicked. She was shouting, “I’m going to die”.’ The inquest at Huntingdon Law Courts heard how Elouise, who had suffered from asthma since she was 18 months old, had not taken part in the sports day but had jogged a short distance. Wing Commander Anthony Kelly, in charge of the Air Cadets, said ambulances had been unable to find the base twice before. The inquest heard that one vehicle got. lost because 'there were too many blue doors' on her street while. another stopped for petrol while answering the 999 call in March. An ambulance was immediately called at 7.44pm but was sent to RAF Wyton, 10 miles away, by mistake. The error meant it did not arrive until 8.03pm. Elouise, who had suffered from asthma since she was 18 months old, died at the scene. Her mother today told an inquest she rushed to her daughter's side after she had called her saying she felt unwell. In October last year, another inquest heard that Evelyn Heath, 93, from Attleborough, Norfolk, died from an irregular heartbeat in the back of an ambulance after the vehicle took more than four hours to reach her care home. Wing Commander Anthony Kelly, who is. in charge of Air Cadets in Huntingdon, told the inquest at Huntingdon.

"(CNN) -- Italy striker Antonio Cassano has apologised for apparent homophobic comments he made in a Euro 2012 press conference. The outspoken striker's comments came after he was asked about an Italian TV personality's claim that there are two gay players in the current Italy squad. Cassano is reported to have responded: ""If they're queer, that's their problem. I hope there aren't any queers in the national team."" The Milan striker's comments were largely laughed off at the time, but sparked outrage among gay rights groups. Those reactions prompted an apology on Tuesday, with Cassano issuing a statement which read: ""I'm sincerely sorry that what I said has sparked controversy and protests from gay associations. ""Homophobia is not a sentiment I feel. I didn't want to offend anyone and I certainly didn't want to call into question anyone's freedom of sexuality. ""I only said it wasn't my problem and I wouldn't allow myself to judge others. Everyone deserves respect."" Campaign group the Gay Centre in Italy had hit out at Cassano's original comments, using an Italian slang phrase for doing something stupid that plays on Cassano's name. ""Cassano says 'cassanate' (stupid things) about gays, showing his arrogance and irresponsibility,"" said spokesman Fabrizio Marrazzo in a statement. ""Unifying sport and homophobia gives a dangerous message, especially to the young,"" he added. Despite gay sportsmen making public their sexuality in other sports, there are no high-profile gay footballers in Europe's major leagues. Gay rights groups have called for someone to step forward and make known their sexuality and last year Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer told Bunte magazine: ""Those players who are homosexual should say so. That would take a load off their minds."" Former Nottingham Forest forward Justin Fashanu is the only English footballer to have come out, later in his career.

"There are few places in Britain you could take these spectacular images - the iridescent colours of the Milky Way illuminating the night sky. But one photographer has found a perfect spot to capture the constellations in stunning definition - the pitch-black countryside of the Isle of Wight. Astro-photographer Jamie Currie, 35, has been taking pictures of the phenomenon in locations across the island over the past 18 months. Scroll down for video. It was on a starry night: Bembridge Lifeboat station on the Isle of Wight photographed at a very low spring tide. Stunning sights: The Milky Way in the countryside (left) and photographer Jamie Currie looking towards its northern part (right) Vibrant scene: Gurnard Beach huts, in an image which has 200 photos laid on top of each other to show the stars moving around the world. Space age: A gorilla-shaped rock facing south-west from Freshwater Bay out to sea (left) and Castlehaven in the south of the island (right) Known for its low levels of light pollution, the idyllic island is a hotspot for stargazers to capture the immense beauty of the disk-shaped galaxy. It contains between 100billion and 400billion stars but cannot be distinguished properly with the naked eye. Mr Currie said: ‘I have always been interested in the night sky and wanted to try something different with my camera. ‘Astro was the way to go. The pictures were all taken on the Isle of Wight over the last 12 to 18 months. It’s turned into a bit of a labour of love. Illuminating the night sky: St Catherine's Oratory, which is the oldest lighthouse on the island - and is said to have been built in 1328. On the lookout: St Catherine's Lighthouse (left), built near the Oratory; and a view from Froglands Lane, south-west of Newport (right) Things are looking up: Galactic hunters chasing the Milky Way capture another couple of stargazers on the Isle of Wight. Colourful stars: Whale Chine steps used for many years - but shut to the public due to recent landslips (left), and hay bales in a field (right) ‘The Isle of Wight is very good for astro-photography due to the little light pollution on the south coast of the island.’ In what looks like a rainbow of stars arched across the night sky, one photograph shows the glowing band looming over St Catherine’s Oratory on the southerly tip of the island. Another depicts Bembridge Lifeboat station below an explosion of luminous colours. According to Mr Currie, a former Royal Marines Commando from the Isle of Wight, most of his shots are taken using a Canon 6D camera over a 30-second period with very high ISO - light sensitivity - levels to capture the Milky Way, which is just visible with the naked eye. Mr Currie said low light pollution is crucial to capturing the galaxy on camera. He said: ‘I have been very interested in taking photos of the Milky Way over the last two years. ‘The light pollution on the Isle of Wight allows me to pull as much possible light into the camera to capture the billions of stars in the galaxy. It’s a truly astounding phenomenon.

"Britain's elite troops operating in Iraq are carrying gas protection suits because Islamic State fighters are feared to have taken control of Syrian chemical weapons. Special Forces units have carried out reconnaissance in the region to provide up-to-date information on the jihadists for RAF airstrikes, and are also training Kurdish fighters battling the regime. But despite international efforts to destroy President Assad's chemical weapon stockpile, it is thought that some may have fallen into the hands of ISIS after the militants seized vast swathes of Iraq and Syria - and they could be used on troops in retaliation for the UK joining the U.S.-led air campaign.

"(CNN) -- Despite the many differences I had with former President George W. Bush on a range of public policy issues, or as he called them, ""decision points,"" I found common ground with him in one area, simply because we decided to put aside partisanship and do something good. Hurricane Katrina's devastation and the bungled rescue efforts are seared in the national memory. Bush's ""heckuva job"" remark turned into a byword for government incompetence and public distrust. The shallowness of it coming at such a terrible and low point left deep wounds that are still healing. That was what it was. But rather than rehash all that went wrong, I want to share what I believe to have been President Bush's determination to follow up on commitments, and the intense, personal, dedicated efforts he made to revive and restore people's futures. I know what I'm talking about. Bush 43: 'History will ultimately judge' Kathleen Blanco, Louisiana's governor in 2005, asked me to serve on the state's commission overseeing the long-term recovery from the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. I've kept a close watch over the last eight years. Hurricane Katrina wasn't one natural disaster: It was a triple whammy of water, winds and lawlessness. An Army Corps engineer on CBS talked this week about Midwest flooding: ""Water is the perfect instrument of destruction,"" he said. He is so right: Katrina's waters laid waste to an area the size of Great Britain. Its winds reached 174 mph and, together, they took 1,833 lives. Every member of my family was displaced by Katrina. Last year, I lost both my father and sister. But I had them with me that much longer because they were rescued from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. My father, Lionel, left New Orleans only two times in his life. The first was to serve his country in Korea. The second was when FEMA evacuated him to San Antonio, Texas. How will history remember George W. Bush? My older sister, Sheila -- people sometimes thought we were twins, we looked so much alike -- was in an assisted care home. Sheila developed a brain tumor in childhood. Brain surgery left her needing help, although she still managed to finish high school and college. When FEMA officials told me it might be weeks before we found Sheila, I was furious. CNN's Wolf Blitzer made a public plea for nearby citizens to see if the residents had survived. Eddie Rodriguez of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and our cousin, Keith, a cop, rescued her from the building's rooftop. Most other residents had left before her. Sheila wouldn't leave until she saw someone she knew. Like so many others, she was relocated to Baton Rouge. My 92-year-old great uncle Henry, a WWII vet, was plucked from another rooftop and transported to Roswell, Georgia, only to suffer a heart attack. All seven of my remaining siblings, my father, uncle, aunts, and other relatives, lost everything in Katrina. I was upset -- mad as hell -- and disappointed But, I made a decision not to act out -- act against Bush -- but rather to turn to his administration for help, and to offer my help. ""Mr. President,"" I said, ""how can I help you?"" ""Civility,"" he said. Opinion: Jury is still out on Bush. Bitterness can corrode the soul. A grudge is like the chains on Marley's ghost. We can carry these chains in life and they weigh us down. President Obama and former President Bush have been working for eight years to change the atmosphere in Washington, to get</s>","Donna Brazile's siblings, father, uncle, aunts, and other relatives lost everything in Katrina.

"A young mother was forced to wait for half an hour after this selfish Audi driver parked just millimetres from her car. Stephanie Adams, 27, was left unable to get into her Vauxhall Corsa after this shocking piece of parking in Nottingham. The mother-of-one decided to shame the thoughtless driver of the navy blue Audi A5 after they left their vehicle almost touching her own. Scroll down for video. Stephanie Adams, 27, was left unable to get into her Vauxhall Corsa after this shocking piece of parking in Nottingham. The driver of the Audi A5 left the vehicle just millimetres from her white coloured Vauxhall Corsa. Stephanie said that she could not climb in through the passenger door because of her child's car seat. The driver of the Audi made sure they had plenty of space to get in and out of their vehicle on the drivers side. 'When I left the car there was a space next to it, but when I came back the car was parked like this,' said the 27-year-old, who was delayed collecting her daughter from nursery. 'My first thought was ''how am I going to get out?'' but then I thought ''how am I going to get in?'' 'The car was parked so close to my mine I couldn't get in, and I didn't think I'd be able to climb over the child seat which is in the passenger seat. 'But even if I did get into the car, I'm not sure I would have been able to reverse out of there anyway.' When the driver of the navy blue 2007 Audi A5 Sport TDI Quattro finally moved his car, there was no damage to her vehicle. The incident happened at the Lace Market car park in Nottingham on February 12. The mother-of-one was also worried about the damaging the Audi if she tried to reverse out.

"By. Michael Zennie. The first alleged client of a Zumba instructor-turned-prostitute in Maine has ended with the alleged John being acquitted. Former Kennebunk High School hockey coach Don Hill has said he was engaged in a relationship with the woman, Alexis Wright, but he never paid for sex. Justice Roland Cole ended Hill's trial Tuesday after barring prosecutors from entering Wright's business ledger into evidence. Acquitted: Donald Hill, the former Kennebunk High School hockey coach was acquitted of paying for sex with the Zumba instructor-turned-prostitute. The trial heated up Tuesday with the defense suggesting the ledger was mishandled as evidence, but Deputy District Attorney Justina McGettigan called the claim 'outrageous.' Mr Hill, who has been divorced for years, was one of 68 people charged with paying for sex with Wright. At least 58 have pleaded guilty or no contest. Wright pleaded guilty and is serving a 10-month sentence, but that didn't stop her from giving her husband an entirely different story. She told him that she had sex with more than 100 men for money because she believed she was working as an undercover agent for the State of Maine investigating'sexual deviancy' in the sleepy town of Kennebunk. Different defense: He said that he had a relationship with Wright (right) and that he did not pay for sex, though her ledger was not allowed to be submitted as part of the evidence against him. Wright appeared in court last week and gave her married name, Alexis Sandra Trowbridge. It appears her husband, Jason Trowbridge, believes her story and is taking her back. Wright, 30, now maintains she was a. pawn all along. It has emerged that Wright claims that Mark Strong, her. business partner who was found guilty of promoting prostitution, told. her that he was on special assignment for the state of Maine and that he. had hired her as his undercover agent. Wright. claims that Strong, a licensed private investigator, told her that the. brothel she operated out of her Zumba studio was really an elaborate. sting operation backed by the state of Maine. The goal, Wright claims she was told, was to catch sexual deviants in Kennebunk. Strong's attorney said Wright's claims are laughable. Pleading the Fifth: Alexis Wright, serving 10 months in jail, took the stand in August and refused to testify against Hill. Wright is claiming that her business partner Mark Strong, a private investigator, told her that he had hired her as an undercover agent. Wright's husband Jason says he believes his wife's story and is standing by her. Prosecutors say she had sex with more than 100 men for money - sometimes five in a day. 'That this woman, who had allegedly taken on 100 or so men to have sex with for money, was investigating for sexual deviancy, is the pot calling the kettle black,' lawyer Daniel G. Lilley told MailOnline. Lilley said it doesn't appear. prosecutors bought her claim. There was no evidence presented at. Strong's trial that he had said he was working for the government. Wright's. husband Jason Trowbridge, however, does seem to believe her. He stood. by his wife in an interview with a TLC documentary called 'Sex, Lies and Zumba.' 'It. sounds crazy. It just made more sense that's what was going on,' Mr. Trowbridge told the documentary. 'Put the pieces together. That fits the. story.

Justine Greening has called for a major shake-up in the EU aid budget – as it emerged more than half the cash is squandered on relatively rich countries. The International Development Secretary challenged the basis of the £10billion-a-year budget, which channels cash to countries such as Turkey, Iceland and Brazil. She is pressing for a major shift in policy to target resources at the poorest countries. International Development Secretary Justine Greening today insisted aid money should be targetted at helping the poorest nations. Miss Greening held talks with. ministers from France, Germany, Ireland, Denmark, Finland and Luxembourg. to build a coalition for reform. She also discussed the issue with the EU’s foreign affairs commissioner, Baroness Ashton. Ms Greening's get-tough message marks shift away from the softly-softly approach of her predecessor, Andrew Mitchell (pictured) Miss Greening said: ‘I don’t think. it’s right that the EU still gives money to those countries higher up. the income scale, when we’ve taken the decision to target the poorest. ‘I’ll be doing everything I can to get other countries on board.’ Her intervention comes amid mounting. concern about the EU aid budget, which receives £1.4billion a year from. the UK, equal to one-sixth of this country’s total aid budget. Figures. prepared for the Commons international development committee reveal that. just 46 per cent of EU aid goes to genuinely needy countries in the. developing world. The figures suggest around £784million. of aid money channelled through Europe now goes to better-off. countries.

"England coach Steve McNamara has kept faith with the team that lost to Australia for Saturday’s must-win Four Nations clash with New Zealand in Dunedin. McNamara made two changes for the 16-12 defeat to the Kangaroos after initially naming the same team that beat Samoa in their opening game, drafting in captain Sean O’Loughlin after he completed his recovery from a leg injury and centre Dan Sarginson in a tactical swap for Michael Shenton. O’Loughlin came through his comeback match unscathed and was cleared to play on Saturday after officials decided he had no case to answer after being placed on report for an alleged trip on Australia skipper Cameron Smith. The England players line-up to sing the national anthem against Australia and are unchanged for New Zealand. Ryan Hall had a last-minute try disallowed as Australia beat England 16-12 in the Four Nations on Sunday. England must now beat New Zealand in their next game to have any chance of winning the Four Nations. Starting team: S Tomkins (New Zealand Warriors); J Charnley (Wigan), K Watkins (Leeds), D Sarginson (Wigan), R Hall (Leeds); G Widdop (St George Illawarra), M Smith (Wigan); G Burgess (South Sydney), J Hodgson (Hull KR), J Graham (Canterbury Bulldogs), L Farrell (Wigan), J Tomkins (Wigan), S O’Loughlin (Wigan, capt). Replacements: D Clark (Castleford), B Ferres (Huddersfield), T Burgess (South Sydney), C Hill (Warrington). Sarginson keeps his place after impressing on his Test debut. England need to beat the Kiwis by 10 points to leapfrog them into top spot on the ladder and guarantee a place in the November 15 final in Wellington.

A daring duo took their lives in their hands to scale a spectacular frozen waterfall as it melted beneath their feet. The climb in Ouray, Colorado, was certainly not for the faint of heart, with one wrong step potentially sending them sliding nearly 100ft to almost certain death at the foot of the sheer ice sheet. But that didn't stop this pair of daredevils rising to the challenge. Heartstopping: Photographer Alain Denis captures. his partner Calixte Leblanc taking on the frozen waterfall climb in. Ouray, Colorado. Slippery: One wrong step could have sent Mr Leblanc plunging nearly 100ft down the frozen waterfall to almost certain death at its frozen base. Don't look down! After the climb Mr Denis spoke. of the intoxicating mixture of adrenaline and fear that possessed him. and Mr Leblanc when they first saw the ice column. Adventure: The frozen waterfall dangling from the San Juan mountains, in a region nicknamed 'the Switzerland of America', was approximately 82ft tall. Adventure sport photographer Alain. Denis, 40, captured these spectacular images of his partner Calixte. Leblanc, 32, taking on the ascent. Using. ice tools, ice screws, crampons and a harness, brave Mr Denis and his. climbing compatriot were able to reach the top of the waterfall in a. mere twenty minutes. 'This. was the first time we were able to climb the frozen waterfall,' said Mr. Denis. 'In the previous years, the [ice] never got fat enough for us to. do it, or didn't reach all the way to the ground. 'When. we first saw it like this it looked scary, but looking back at. photographs reminds me of the excitement we had when we first saw this. free standing pillar, the adrenaline and fear of climbing it.' The. frozen waterfall dangling from the San Juan mountains, in a region. nicknamed 'the Switzerland of America', was approximately 82ft tall. Great outdoors: This photograph of the climb from another angle shows just how precarious the ascent of the waterfall was. Kitted out: Using ice tools, ice screws, crampons and a harness, brave Mr Denis and Mr Leblanc were able to reach the top of the waterfall in a mere twenty minutes. First ascent: Mr Denis explained that in previous years the column had not been substantial enough to climb, or had not reached all the way to the ground. Dramatic: Mr Leblanc swings his ice axe as he inches his way to the top of the waterfall, which apparently collapsed only a few weeks later. Talking about the climb, Mr Denis explained: 'Once we got back to the car park at the bottom of the mountain, a local told us that we had just completed the first accent of the frozen waterfall. 'We later found out that only a few more ascents were completed after us, and several weeks later the pillar fell down. 'I always loved adrenaline sports, loved to be in the mountains and be in nature.

A tearful uncle has spoken about the moment he discovered the bodies of his two young nephews who had been stabbed to death by their mother. Leighton Dennis walked in on the grisly scene at the Manchester home of Romario Mullings-Sewell, two, and three-month-old Delayno Mullings-Sewell.

Tragic: Leighton Dennis walked in on the grisly scene at the Manchester home of Romario Mullings-Sewell, left, two, and his brother three-month-old Delayno. Mullings was sectioned indefinitely after killing Romario and Delayno on November 12, 2008. She denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Mr Dennis and his mother Andrea found the youngsters’ bodies at their home in Kilmington Drive, Cheetham Hill. They had became increasingly worried after Mullings, then 21, arrived at her auntie’s house without her two sons. She said that she was 'the devil’ and her sons were ‘at peace’, the inquest at Manchester Crown Court heard. Grim task: A forensic team enter the house in Kilmington Drive, Cheetham Hill, where the brothers were found dead. Horrifying: Mr Dennis and his mother took a taxi to Kilmington Drive and found the door unlocked - they shouted out Romario’s name but they did not get an answer, so made their way upstairs and made found the two bodies. Mr Dennis and his mother took a taxi to Kilmington Drive and found the door unlocked. Mr Dennis said the house was ‘a bit messy’ and added: 'It didn’t seem normal at all. There’s a sort of organised chaos with kids around and it’s never completely tidy. But it seemed as if something had happened.” Mr Dennis and his mum shouted out Romario’s name but they did not get an answer, so made their way upstairs. Leading Mr Dennis through his evidence, Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows said: 'Very sadly when you came into Jael’s room you saw the two children.' Troubled: Jael Mullings said that she was 'the devil' and her sons were 'at peace', the inquest at Manchester Crown Court heard. 'Yes,' replied Mr Dennis. Mr Meadows said: 'Essentially it was obvious to you that they had been injured and in simple terms there was understandable panic and there was a need to phone an ambulance. I think the children were lying on the bed?' 'Yes they were,' said Mr Dennis, who was then overcome with grief and bent over in tears. The inquest earlier heard how Mr Dennis was close to his sister and visited her once or twice a week. He told how Mullings developed an interest in religion and the search for truth. Mr Dennis said: 'As she was growing up she expressed strong spiritual beliefs. 'She wasn’t an avid churchgoer. She wanted to seek the truth.

"By. Andy Dolan. When the country basked in temperatures warmer than the Mediterranean earlier this month, it seemed spring had finally sprung. But just two weeks later, the weather is not so much balmy as barmy.

Unusual scene: Mr Shackleton said he had only previously seen snow in Princetown, Devon, in the 1990s. And in Devon – where businesses are. turning their thoughts to the summer tourist trade – snow flurries gave. villages a winter wonderland theme. The scenes prompted Ladbrokes to slash the odds of snow falling over the bank holiday weekend. Elsewhere, Devon and Cornwall were. lashed by 65mph gales which caused power cuts, ripped slates from roofs. and felled trees and telephone lines, while parts of Carmarthenshire. were soaked with three inches of rain – a month’s worth in just one day. Blizzards also fell over Wales as the. unseasonal conditions swept north east towards the Pennines and. Newcastle upon Tyne. The miserable weather was a far cry from the May.

"By. Daniel Miller. PUBLISHED:. 06:45 EST, 14 December 2012. |. UPDATED:. 07:26 EST, 14 December 2012. Mobile phone apps which allow wives and husbands to spy on their spouses by monitoring their whereabouts as well as their calls and text messages will be banned under a new law to be put before congress. Software companies are currently able to sell so-called cyberstalking apps that operate secretly on cellphones thanks to a loophole in current laws. Apps such Retina Software's SpouseSpy or ePhoneTracker, which sell for around $50 online, have become increasingly popular among jealous wives or husbands, but there are concerns they could be encouraging stalking and domestic violence. Cyberspy: Mobile phone apps such as SpouseSpy allow users to monitor their partners' whereabouts and mobile phone communications. After being installed on a person's phone, ePhoneTracker works by automatically emailing details of their activities to the worried partner. 'Suspect your spouse is cheating?' the company's website says. 'Don't break the bank by hiring a private investigator.' Their website proudly describes how the app'silently records EVERYTHING including full SMS messages, call info, GPS locations, web sites visited, contacts added and more'. But yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill that makes it a crime for companies to make and intentionally operate a stalking app. The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., also would curb the appeal for such inexpensive and easy-to-use programs by requiring companies to disclose their existence on a target's phone. Stalking and wiretapping already are illegal, but there are no provisions in federal law that clearly prohibit businesses from making an app whose primary purpose is to help one person stalk another. Sen. Franken's proposal would extend the criminal and civil liabilities for the improper use of the apps to include the software companies that sell them. The proposal would update laws passed years before wireless technology revolutionized communications. Telephone companies currently are barred from disclosing to businesses the locations of people who make traditional phone calls. But there's no such prohibition when communicating over the Internet. If a mobile device sends an email, links to a website or launches an app, the precise location of the phone can be passed to advertisers, marketers and others without the user's permission. 'What's most troubling is this: Our law is not protecting location information,' said Sen. Franken, chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law. An emailed statement from Retina Software said the program is for the lawful monitoring of a cellphone that the purchaser of the software owns and has a right to monitor. 'If there is evidence the customer doesn't own the phone, the account is closed, the company said. The program is not intended or marketed for malicious purposes and doesn't facilitate stalking, the statement said. The spy apps are also marketed as a way for concerned parents to monitor their children's mobile phones. But Franken and supporters of his bill said there is no way to ensure the rules are followed. These programs can be installed in moments, perhaps while the cellphone's actual owner is sleeping or in the shower. The apps operate invisibly to the cellphone's user. They can silently record text messages, call logs, physical locations and visits to websites. All the information is relayed to an email address chosen by the installer.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan militias surrendered their Tripoli bases to the military on Thursday, nearly a week after growing public anger over the presence of armed groups in the capital sparked deadly clashes. In a series of ceremonies across the coastal city, militias from Tripoli as well as smaller towns such as Zintan handed over their bases to the authorities, including the Ministry of Defence and Libyan air force. These included the Mitiga airbase, as well as the Islamic Call Center. Public anger has been growing over the armed groups' refusal to disarm in the two years since they toppled the North African country's longtime leader, Moammar Gadhafi. Last Friday, Tripoli residents marched on the headquarters of militias from the city of Misrata. The militia opened fire on unarmed demonstrators, unleashing heavy clashes that left 47 people dead and more than 500 injured in the worst violence in the city in two years. Misrata militias withdrew from Tripoli earlier this week, but it was not immediately clear where the militias that handed over their bases on Thursday would go. They include a number of powerful and heavily armed groups. Other groups remain in Tripoli. Government officials attending the ceremonies nonetheless praised the handover as a major step toward building the Libyan state and its security forces. During a press conference at one of the ceremonies, Prime Minister Ali Zeidan lashed out at a reporter who asked whether the government had guarantees the handovers were real, and not ceremonial.

"Ships could be sailing right across the North Pole by the middle of the century, US experts predict. By around 2050 the Arctic ice sheet will be thin enough for icebreakers to carve a straight path between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, it is claimed. ‘Nobody's ever talked about shipping over the top of the North Pole,’ said lead researcher Professor Laurence Smith, from the University of California in Los Angeles. ‘This is an entirely unexpected possibility.’ Meanwhile, cargo ships and tankers could routinely be making voyages through Arctic Ocean channels that are currently impossible for them to navigate on their own. Ships could be sailing right across the North Pole by the middle of the century, US experts predict. The scientists studied seven well-established climate simulations for the years 2040 to 2059 to estimate the future thickness of sea ice in the Arctic. They then used a computer programme to look for potential new shipping routes opening up in September, the Arctic's most navigable month of the year. By mid-century most common open-water ships will be able, without the help of icebreakers, to cross the Northern Sea Route hugging the coast of Russia, the forecast shows. The route is about 40 per cent shorter than plotting a course through the Suez Canal. Sailing directly over the North Pole would provide a passage for icebreakers between the world's two greatest oceans which is 20 per cent shorter than the Northern Sea Route. Even the fabled and notoriously treacherous Northwest Passage, which traces Canada's coastline, could be opened up to ordinary shipping, say the researchers. It is expected to become navigable for vessels which are strengthened against ice, and even some ships with unreinforced hulls. Today, the Northwest Passage can only be crossed in one of every seven years on average, making it too unreliable for commercial shipping. But by 2050 the September sea ice is expected to melt to the point that it is accessible every other year. For centuries the Arctic Ocean has captured the imagination of explorers because of the possibility of travelling between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans through the Bering Strait. By 2050 the Arctic ice sheet will be thin enough for icebreakers to carve a path between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Until recently, thick ice has blocked this inviting short cut linking Asia with North America and Europe. But in the past two years, the ice has started to melt in late summer sufficiently to allow ordinary vessels escorted by icebreakers to venture into the Arctic. Last summer, a total of 46 voyages were successfully completed along the Northern Sea Route. The new research is published online in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Scenarios assuming low-to-medium and relatively high increases in temperature both had the same dramatic impact on Arctic sea ice, the scientists found. ‘No matter what carbon emission scenario is considered, by mid-century we will have passed a crucial tipping point - sufficiently thin sea ice - enabling moderately capable icebreakers to go where they please,’ said Professor Smith. The predictions have major implications for commercial shipping, the exploitation of natural resources and the jurisdiction of shipping lanes. A more accessible Arctic could also fuel international disagreements, say the researchers. For instance, Canada has long maintained that the Northwest Passage falls under its sovereignty while the US maintains it is an international stretch of water. While the passage is essentially un-navigable, the issue is moot. But increasing accessibility could bring the US into a dispute with its northern neighbour.

Lawyer David Latham threw himself in front of a Tube train the day after he had warned a colleague he was going to kill himself. A partner at a top law firm who threw himself under a Tube train had warned a colleague he was going to kill himself the day before, an inquest has heard. Colleagues of David Latham, 58, a world-renowned trademark lawyer at Hogan and Lovells, had noticed he was 'inconsolable' as he worried over the fate of a big case. After weeks of sleepless nights, the father-of-three, from Kensington, west London, told a fellow partner that he was planning to kill himself but the remark was dismissed as a 'flippant comment'. The next day, on February 15 this year, Mr Latham jumped in front of a tube train in west London. His wife, Gillian Webb, told Westminster Coroner's Court more should have been done by his employers to help her husband. She said: 'If a person shows the signs as David clearly had, they should have something put in place to prevent such tragedies.' Ms Webb said Mr Latham's colleague only revealed his threat to kill himself after he had failed to show up for work the day he died. 'She said David came into the office and said I'm going to kill myself', she said. 'She said he went into the office and closed the door, which is normally lawyer-speak for ""this is important"".' Nicholas MacFarlane, another partner at the law firm, said Mr Latham was a 'perfectionist' who was beset with worries that a big case he was handling had come unstuck because of evidence problems. 'He was worried the whole thing would reflect badly on him', he said. 'He thought he had made a mistake and he was very concerned about that. Mr Latham was a world-renowned trademark lawyer at Hogan and Lovells. 'He definitely got very exercised about it, and I used the word inconsolable. However much we persuaded him that it wasn't important, he thought it was.' Mr MacFarlane said the threat to kill. himself had been dismissed as a 'flippant comment', but constant efforts. were made to reassure him the mistake did not matter and may not ever. have been discovered. He said: 'The firm is actively looking at how to give support to stressed lawyers. 'But not one of us said ""my God, he is near to the edge of suicide"". 'When he said he was going to kill himself, it was a flippant comment and unfortunately no one took any notice of it.' Ms Webb said her husband had complained of not being supported at work as the strain of the case took its toll. Westminster Coroner's Court heard how Mr Latham had struggled to sleep in the weeks before he jumped in front of a train. She said: 'The client had taken the stand and introduced evidence that wasn't in the affidavit, it had upset David and he had to go back and rewrite the affidavit and submit it to the court. 'He was very upset that it wasn't going to look good for him, but more importantly for the firm. 'I said you can't legislate for how people act on witness stand, it was out of his hands.</s>","David Latham had trouble sleeping for weeks as he worried about case.

"Kirsty Gallacher says her dad 'would be dead if it wasn’t for the first aid he was given' So many details surrounding golfer Bernard Gallacher’s sudden cardiac arrest in August last year remain a mystery. Prior to the attack, he had not suffered any symptoms or ill health. And, although the cause – an ‘electrical fault’ – has now been determined, doctors still cannot be sure why his heart stopped beating that day. But there is one thing on which doctors do agree: Bernard is extremely lucky to be alive. The 65-year-old, who played in eight Ryder Cups and captained Europe three times in the competition, mercifully remembers nothing of the event. As he stood up to give a speech after dinner at the Marcliffe Hotel in Aberdeen, he ‘just fell over, as if a boxer had landed a punch’. At first ‘people in the audience thought it was part of my act’, Bernard has recalled since, jokingly. His next memory came more than a week later in intensive care, with his distraught wife Lesley, and children Laura, Jamie and television presenter Kirsty, at his bedside. So, yes, many unknowns. Yet there is one certainty: were it not for the swift intervention of those in the audience who knew first aid, Bernard would not have survived. While acknowledging their incredible good fortune, Sky Sports star Kirsty, 38, still finds it hard to recount the dreadful days watching over her perilously ill father. And so, as she opens the nominations for the fourth St John Ambulance Everyday Heroes awards, she has issued an impassioned plea: ‘My dad would be dead if it wasn’t for the first aid he was given. These are skills anyone can learn – and everyone should. ‘I have, as luckily Sky offers courses. In fact, I’ve done the course twice. It’s not just cardiac arrests or heart attacks but everyday things such as cuts, burns or choking. ‘The fact is, if you don’t know what to do in a situation like that – whether it’s a family member in need or a stranger in the street – you’re helpless, and all you can do is stand by, watch and do nothing. Imagine how you’d feel if someone died when you could have helped save them.’ Among the audience at the Marcliffe that day was Colin Leyden, who by coincidence trains oil-rig workers in how to use defibrillators. These machines deliver a short electric shock via adhesive pads placed on the chest to restart the heart in the event of a cardiac arrest. A nurse – again, at the event by coincidence – performed chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth, while Mr Leyden, 44, rushed to the hotel gym to retrieve the defibrillator, which is also known as an AED. Together the pair kept his heart going for more than 20 minutes before paramedics arrived and took over. Bernard’s heart stopped three times – and each time the AED brought him back to life. Earlier this month, Bernard was able to meet his saviour and shake him by the hand. ‘What do you say to the guy who saves your life?’ he has said. ‘Thanks very much, for a start.’ 'We all feared the worst': Kirsty and her father Bernard, who suffered sudden cardiac arrest in August last year.

"(CNN) -- ""Batman: Arkham City"" takes everything that was great about the first Arkham title and makes it bigger, bolder and better. The Dark Knight goes up against his most murderous foes with new weapons and allies in a story that expands the Batman universe. Spinning off the ending of ""Batman: Arkham Asylum,"" Gotham City decides that the best way to house all of its criminals is to wall off a large section of the city and dump them all together. So now, Joker, Penguin, Two-Face and others are free to do whatever they want inside those walls. Out of sight, out of mind. The 18-month backstory of the game was presented in a limited series by DC Comics in the months leading up to the game's release. If you didn't read the series, there may be some confusion about what's going on when the gameplay begins. The city is beautifully rendered, with plenty of locations that are unique to Batman's enemies. Although the regular prisoners tend to repeat themselves, each villain looks and feels very unique and true to their comic book counterparts. It also helps that Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy reprise their voice roles as the Joker and Batman, respectively. Those trademark voices have become as necessary as the Joker's laugh or Batman's scowl. Combat is similar to ""Arkham Asylum,"" as rhythmic button pushing sends Batman from foe to foe in a fluid and almost dance-like movement with devastating effects. The more times you can string together attacks will open new power moves that can daze or level multiple opponents. Batman's utility belt is full with some of the same ""toys"" as before but with new abilities and functions. Batarangs, batclaws and explosive gels are back, with additional weapons like smoke pellets and a new Cryptographic Sequencer to help the Caped Crusader escape from trouble or solve puzzles. Tutorials and the Batcomputer will help you master the skills needed to succeed as well as help point you in the direction of the next objective. Arkham City is five times the size Arkham Asylum was, so it is easy to get lost or misplace a mission. Batman spends most of his time traveling this new territory by grapnel gun and gliding. There is an opportunity to get a grapnel boost, so use it and it will cut down the time it takes to get around. In all, there are more than 250 upgrades and collectibles that help increase Batman's skills, armor and weaponry. Take advantage of each when you can. All that real estate needs to be occupied, and developers filled it up with some of Batman's most famous and deadly foes. Each of them wants to rule over the prisoners in Arkham City but is willing to take their shots at the Dark Knight when they can. Mr. Freeze, the Riddler, Two-Face, Harley Quinn and, of course, the Joker are ready to battle Batman in their own ways. Each has a unique agenda, and part of the gameplay is figuring out what they are up to and how best to stop it. The main storyline is filled with intrigue and drama. Fighting skills alone will not win the day, and Batman is again equipped with a Detective mode that lets him spot clues normal eyes can't see. In ""Arkham Asylum,"" this mode could be turned on and pretty much left on at all times. In ""Arkham City,"" the mode stays on until Batman takes a hit. Players will not want to leave it on the entire time, because they'll miss other things that are needed to complete other missions.

"(CNN) -- Legendary Ukraine striker Andriy Shevchenko called time on an 18-year soccer career back in July in order to concentrate on a new profession -- politics. But just four months after turning his back on football, Shevchenko has been offered the chance to immerse himself in the beautiful game once again, as coach of the national side. As Ukraine's most capped player and their highest goalscorer of all time, with 56 goals in his 111 games, Shevchenko is the finest player the country has produced since gaining independence in 1991. He won five consecutive league titles with Dynamo Kiev between 1995 and 1999 before joining Italian giants AC Milan, where he played his part in their 2003 European Champions League triumph. Shevchenko was signed for English club Chelsea by Jose Mourinho in May 2006 for a reported fee of $47 million but failed to make an impact in his two years at the club. After another loan spell with Milan he returned to Dynamo Kiev for three final seasons and signed off from the national team after they failed to get out of their group in Euro 2012, which Ukraine co-hosted with neighbors Poland. Though the 36-year-old has no previous coaching experience, he is the Ukrainian Football Federation's (FFU) first choice to take over from Oleh Blokhin, who left the post to coach Ukrainian club side Dynamo Kiev.

"By. Lydia Warren. The teenager whose insurance company refused to pay for dentures after he lost his teeth beating two different types of cancer now has the money to pay for them thanks to the kindness of strangers. Alex Hunter, 16, raised the $11,000 he needs through his gofundme page in just 20 hours, so touched were the public by his story. Alex, from Delano, California, made the tough decision to get his 19 remaining teeth removed two weeks ago after years of radiation left them fragile and impossible to use. While his insurance - which is provided by the state because of his mother's job working for Bakersfield - covered part of the procedure to remove the teeth, it would not cover the dentures, his family said. 'They say it's not a medical issue but they know they took out the teeth because of a medical issue,' his grandmother, Roberta Hunter, told MailOnline earlier on Tuesday. 'It feels like the insurance is just bailing out on him.' Fighter: Alex Hunter, 16, has had all of his teeth removed after battling cancer twice -and his insurance company declined to cover his dentures because it is not a medical issue. Now the teenager, who loves to sing and one day hopes to be a counselor, will be able to go ahead and get his dentures fitted. Alex's family, who have never asked for anything throughout Alex's 11 years of treatments launched their gofundme page, Alex Hunter's Medical Fund, only yesterday in the hope of raising the money. By Tuesday afternoon, when the MailOnline first published Alex's story, the fund stood at $1,000, but in a little less than six hours had smashed through its target. The family is also applying for funds through various charitable foundations - anything that can help Alex get back his smile. Goal reached: Alex Hunter's gofundme page has managed to raise the $11,000 he needs to have dentures fitted after his insurance company declined to pay for them. On the mend: Alex was first diganosed with cancer when he was four and overcame it, before being diagnosed again when he was 13. His family is now hopeful that he is cancer-free for the second time. 'He doesn't smile because his teeth were never attractive,' his grandmother said earlier about the brave teen. 'He was anxious to get them out and get it over with but now we're waiting to see what's next.' Inspiration: Despite his health struggles, Alex is a top student who dreams of becoming a counselor. Alex was just four when he was first diagnosed with a rare type of cancer, Embryonal Parameningeal Rhabdomyosarcoma, after a mass started growing in his cheek. He underwent aggressive chemotherapy and stayed in hospital for months as he battled the side effects of the radiation. He lost vision in his left eye and feeling on the left side of his face. He was also left with a thin frame, teeth problems and thyroid gland issues, but in July 2003, doctors said he was cancer-free. Then in November 2011, when he was 13, he was back to hospital to undergo surgery on an enlarged thyroid gland - and doctors learned he had Hurthle Cell Carcinoma, a rare thyroid cancer. On the gofundme page, his family explained that the cancer is believed to be an effect of treatment from his first battle with cancer. But now, nearly three years on from his second diagnosis, and his family say he is free from cancer again. One final scan in October will confirm that he is again cancer-free. In the meantime, Alex is impressing his family with his commitment as a student and a friend.

"(CNN) -- If you've ever wondered what happens when you mix a sentient gorilla with a helicopter, look no further! This and many other questions are answered during the course of Rupert Wyatt's compelling and invigorating ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" And if you're looking for a summer popcorn film that won't talk down to you, you've found it. I went into the screening of ""Rise"" with low expectations, and there were many reasons for my trepidation. ""Congo"" would be one of them (""Oh, no! The bad apes have the crystal lasers!"") and pretty much every other misguided reboot or ""intelligent animal"" movie since the original ""Planet of the Apes"" series ended in 1973 would be the others. Thankfully, you don't have to worry, as Fox's restart of the legendary franchise delivers on almost every front. To my surprise and delight, ""Rise"" is what had become a summer movie rarity: fun, engrossing and a way to escape the heat without being treated like a 10-year-old boy. Believe it or not, ""Rise"" is also reasonably intelligent. Well, as intelligent as is possible, given the subject matter. It is, after all, basically a popcorn flick. With several nods and winks to the previous franchise, ""Rise"" clearly knows which side of its bread is buttered, and fan boys and girls will not be disappointed. References are made both verbally and visually to the original, but don't worry if you're not (yet) a fan of the classic. No prior knowledge is required. The film opens with Will Rodman (James Franco) working in a biotech lab at a company called Gen-Sys (get it?) developing what he hopes is a cure for Alzheimer's by experimenting on chimpanzees. You see, Will's father (John Lithgow) has the disease, and Will's hellbent on curing him. As this is an ""animals in a lab"" movie, something is bound to go wrong. In this case, one of Will's subjects, Bright Eyes, seemingly goes berserk, and Will's project is shut down on the eve of its approval for human testing. Not allowing himself to be constrained by anything as trite as rules or ethics, Will not only takes his research home with him (he adopts an infant chimp that has been exposed to the experimental drug), but he also begins treating his father Charles with the serum. Here is where the film takes off, both emotionally and technologically. Unlike the animatronics of old, the special effects of ""Rise"" are astonishing. While the film ostensibly stars Franco, Lithgow, Freida Pinto and several other noted actors, the real star of the show is Caesar, the digitally created chimp brought to life by Weta Digital -- the company that sprang to prominence for its work on Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy -- and by actor Andy Serkis.

"By. Associated Press. Last updated at 11:07 AM on 28th December 2011. A 14-year-old Alaska girl is in critical condition days after a 26-year-old man injected her with heroin at his Anchorage home, authorities said today. Sean Warner is charged with a drug-related felony and other counts. Court documents say Warner tried to revive the girl himself and did not immediately call police. 'Her condition is dire,' Assistant District Attorney Regan Williams said today, adding the girl was on an artificial respirator. 'The real sadness is that there's not that much brain activity.' Scroll down for video. Accused: Sean Warner is charged with delivering a controlled substance to a minor, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and evidence tampering. The girl continued to be treated on Tuesday at an Anchorage hospital, where she was taken Friday with a drug overdose, police said. Charging documents say the girl, identified only as J.D., was found to have heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine in her system. Medics told authorities the girl had sustained damage to her brain and heart. Warner's bail was set at $90,000. A booking official said Warner remained in custody. KTUU reports that Warner's father and a friend dispute the allegations and they say Warner is a Navy veteran who saved lives as a medic in Afghanistan. The two said Warner had struggled since returning from the war. Warner is being represented by the Public Defender Agency, but it was unclear if he has been assigned to a specific attorney yet. Dangerous: Warner had a gram of heroin and the girl said she was willing to try something 'new', but didn't want to inject herself, according to court files. According to the court papers, two others went with Warner to pick the girl up on Thursday night and take her back to Warner's home to hang out. Williams said both of the witnesses are men. Warner was sharing a gram of heroin with the men, and the girl said she was willing to try something 'new', but didn't want to inject herself, according to the documents. Warner tried to inject the girl, but failed, so he had her lie down on his bed and hold out an arm, then used his belt as a tourniquet and shot 25 to 30 units of heroin, taking several times to find a vein, the papers say. The two witnesses told authorities they left the girl on the bed and found her the next morning, face down in her vomit, according to the papers. 'They felt for her pulse, sat her up, and grew concerned at her condition and upset at Warner's ambivalence,' the documents state. Scene: It is believed two others went with Warner to pick the girl up on Thursday night and take her back to Warner's home (pictured) to hang out. Tragic: The two witnesses told authorities they left the girl on the bed and found her the next morning, face down in her vomit at the Alaska home.

"A 20-year-old woman who was beaten and held captive in a cupboard for a decade by her aunt - a convicted killer - is suing the city of Philadelphia for failing to prevent the horrifying ordeal. Beatrice Weston claims the city failed to properly train its care workers, resulting in her being given to her aunt, who had served eight years behind bars for starving her sister's boyfriend to death in 1981. Weston was allegedly beaten with a baseball bat, forced to consume her own urine, held in a tiny closet and prostituted in the 10 years she was in the custody of her aunt, Linda Ann Weston. The cruel conditions were discovered last October when four mentally-disabled adults were found in the dank, cramped basement of an apartment building where her aunt lived. Victim: Beatrice Weston is pictured in October after she was rescued from her aunt's home, where she was allegedly locked up for 10 years. She is now suing the city for failing to prevent the abuse. Accused: She says authorities should not have placed her in the care of her aunt, Linda Weston (pictured) as she had served eight years in prison for starving a man to death in 1981 (mug shot, right) The elder Weston and three others - including her daughter - were arrested, accused of holding the victims captive in order to claim on their Social Security checks. The abuse came even though Linda Weston had served eight years in prison after her first victim, Bernardo Ramos, 'was held captive for an extended period. of time, locked in a closet and literally starved to death', Police. Commissioner Charles Ramsey said. Beatrice Weston's complaint says the city of Philadelphia failed to release information about the aunt's criminal history in 2002, after her mother said she could not care for her. Workers failed to carry out home. investigations or arrange for health evaluations of Beatrice, according to the lawsuit, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Dank: Weston is also accused of locking up four mentally disabled adults in the basement of her building. Cruel: The victims were found hiding under blankets and chained to walls last October by the landlord. It also names two other. defendants, Nefertiti Savoy, a former social worker with the Department of Human Services, and Richard Ames, an. attorney who recommended Weston be given to her aunt. 'Beatrice Weston was forcibly prostituted by Linda Ann Weston and was regularly beaten, starved, and denied medical and dental care, as well as schooling,' the lawsuit states. 'During these 10 years, the City of Philadelphia received numerous complaints that Linda Ann Weston was holding children captive in her basement.' The suit seeks damages for her anguish, payment for her medical and therapy expenses, and compensation for loss of past and future earnings, the Inquirer reported. 'Jurors are going to have to fix a value on every day, every month, every year that she was imprisoned,' her attorney Shanin Specter said. 'There's no amount of money that's fair.' Lair: Police officers show the basement where the four adults were kept so the suspects could take their Social Security checks. Beatrice Weston was locked in a cupboard upstairs. Killer: Linda Weston had been imprisoned for locking up her sister's boyfriend and starving him to death. Horrifying: Sgt. Joseph Green stands in the basement room where the victims were forced to urinate and bathe in a bucket for 10 days. Beatrice Weston said she was locked up for 10 years. She added that Weston is planning to go to school later this year.

For example, Malia, a sophomore in high school, is allowed to date and the daughters are given permission to have frequent sleepovers on the White House's third floor. 'I still am not a big believer in Facebook for young people... particularly for them, because they're in the public eye,' Mrs Obama said in the interview, her first with the President this year. With President Obama leaving his post as commander-in-chief in 2016, the parents say they encourage their daughters to grow personally through other avenues. Though Mrs Obama won't reveal whether Malia is in fact dating anyone at the moment, she said that the teenager 'can't wait until this light has dimmed to start becoming a person.' 'You know, we think about not just her life here, but her life after,' said Mrs Obama. 'Because she's gotta be an independent, strong, smart, capable woman in the world. So she has to get her training now.' Touching on family life in the White House, Mrs Obama admitted that their home is a'sanctuary.' While Sasha isn't old enough to be on Facebook yet, Malia's access to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social networks is still limited. 'The girls are there and they dominate,' she said. 'They're not talking about issues of the day, they're talking about. issues of their day, which has nothing to do with what is going on in the rest of the world. 'Everyone has to have their safe haven, a place of peace and calm: that's. home for us,' Mrs Obama added, saying that she 'tries to stay out' of the President's ear when he is home.

"By. Claire Bates. PUBLISHED:. 11:53 EST, 23 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 11:53 EST, 23 November 2012. A toddler who was violently sick almost every hour of the day for the first 18 months of her life has finally been cured. Leah Hamid, now two, suffered from a rare digestive disorder, which stopped her from digesting her food and caused chronic sickness. She slept through the night for the first time since her birth after specialist surgeons opened up an obstruction causing the condition. Leah Hamid, now two, suffered from a rare disorder which stopped her digesting food and caused chronic sickness. Leah's condition, called duodenal stenosis, is a rare birth defect where a portion of the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) is narrowed. This prevents the stomach contents from flowing through at a normal rate. It's not known what causes the condition, although there may be a genetic link. Fortunately, surgeons at The Children’s Hospital, Sheffield, were confident that surgery would resolve the situation. And, in a lucky twist of fate, Leah would be the first child with her condition to have a procedure that left no scar. In the past, duodenal stenosis has been treated by an invasive operation which leaves scarring. But rather than making an incision to access the duodenum, surgeons decided they could access it by putting a flexible telescope down Leah's throat. She slept through the night for the first time ever after specialist surgeons opened up an obstruction causing the condition. During the three-hour procedure, they freed up the obstruction in her small intestine, leaving no scar or sign of surgery. Doctors snipped holes in the membrane covering. the first part of her small intestine connecting her stomach to her. digestive system using a balloon and electrical knife. Leah's mother Amanda, 34, said: 'She was like a different child after the operation, she recovered straight away and wasn’t sick. 'When she slept through the night for the first time ever I almost cried. My body naturally woke me up throughout the night to check on her and when I found her fast asleep it was amazing. I was so happy my baby was finally better.' Now recovered, Leah can play with her sister Alisha and brother Callum again. Mrs Hamid, who also has five other. children, Ashley 17, Adam 15, Alisha 11, Callum six and Cayden 18. months, continued: 'We are so grateful for the help the surgeons have. given not only to Leah and me but to my husband and all our children. 'Now Leah is living a normal life we have much more time to spend as a family and I can concentrate on all my children equally.' Mr Sean Marven, consultant paediatric surgeon at Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, who performed the operation with colleague Dr Mike Thomson, said: 'I believe this procedure has never been performed on a child with this condition in the UK before due to the rare specialist skills and equipment it requires. 'I decided the it was possible as my colleague is a rare paediatric endoscopist who has the skills to perform the procedure, and because we possess the specialist equipment needed, including a double channel operating endoscope which cost £64,000, and was funded by The Children's Hospital Charity.' He added: 'The operation was a complete. success, Leah was in much less pain and had a quicker recovery. If it. had been done the regular way it would have left a big scar.

U.S. Marines sweep for bombs in Afghanistan this week. During a visit to troops at Fort Drum, New York, on Thursday, Gates said he is waiting to hear what Gen. Stanley McChrystal recommends after he completes a review of operations in Afghanistan. McChrystal is expected to complete a classified report for Gates by the end of this month, assessing where the war stands, and what needs to be done. He will tell Gates whether he needs more U.S. troops to fight the escalating conflict, according to a senior U.S. military official. Gates asked McChrystal to ""state his requirements for resources,"" said the official -- who did not want to be identified because the report is not completed. The review is also expected to recommend that the number of Afghan troops be increased beyond the goal of 134,000, other military sources said. During a speech and question-and-answer session with troops at Fort Drum, Gates acknowledged he would consider a recommendation to boost U.S. troops beyond the level of 68,000 already approved.

"A former Vassar student has sued the college after being expelled over what he says are false rape claims. Xiaolu 'Peter' Yu says he lost his virginity to Mary Claire Walker in February last year after a party, but she later accused him of rape and the school expelled him. Yu, a student from China, says he and Walker, both on the college's rowing teams, went back to his dorm room after a rowing club party on February 18, 2012, where they had consensual sex. Rowing row: Xiaolu 'Peter' Yu and Mary Claire Walker were both celebrating with teammates at a bar when, according to Yu, they went back to his dorm room to have consensual sex. According to the New York Post, papers filed by Yu in a Manhattan federal court yesterday say that he was expelled on Walker’s 'flimsy say-so', alleging that male students at the. formerly all-female college in Poughkeepsie are 'invariably found. guilty' when female students accuse them of sexual misconduct. The documents say that Yu and Walker, who is the daughter of a Vassar geology professor, engaged in 'clearly consensual sexual activity' in Yu's Vassar dorm room, and that Walker even sent Yu a message on Facebook the next day, telling him she 'had a wonderful time.' It's not known why Walker, who is due to graduate in 2014, accused Yu of rape a year after the alleged event, but the school's action was swift. Vassar's regulations state that 'Any student accused of rape will automatically and concurrently be charged with attempted rape, sexual assault, and attempted sexual assault. The minimum sanction for any student found guilty of rape will be immediate expulsion from the college.' Vassar girl: Mary Claire Walker remains a student at Vassar where her father is a geology professor and she studies biochemistry. Yu says the night he lost his. virginity, Walker was a willing participant. Before the pair arrived at. Yu's dorm, Walker had called her own roommate to see if they could. spend the night in her dorm room. In. Yu's dorm room, he told Walker it was his first time, and she told him. not to worry: 'It's OK, I know what to do,' the New York Post reports. Walker responded, before engaging in oral sex with Yu. Walker later put a condom on Yu and they had sex until his roommate came home, after which Walker 'began to lament about her. ex-boyfriend and stated that she was not ready to jump into anything. new' with Yu. The. documents filed with the Manhattan federal court state Walker then got. dressed and left after noting that she 'took Peter Yu’s. virginity,' reports the paper. Yu is seeking unspecified damages on. grounds including gender discrimination, breach of contract and. intentional infliction of emotional distress. Historical: Vassar is a private liberal arts college which was founded as a women's college in 1861 and became coeducational in 1969. The court documents say Yu later learned that two women also on the rowing team, one of whom was his 'former romantic interest', had tried to contact campus security when they saw Yu walking home with Walker, 'who appeared to be drunk.' It's not clear what evidence was provided to Vassar to support Walker's claims, but Max Fraad-</s>","Xiaolu 'Peter' Yu was expelled from Vassar College where he was a sophomore after what he says are false rape claims made by Mary Claire Walker.

"A former British soldier who belonged to an undercover unit in Northern Ireland has claimed he and his colleagues resorted to ‘murder and mayhem’ during a secret campaign against the IRA. Simon Cursey was a member of a 30-man team which would ‘shoot first and ask questions later’. They shot at least 20 terrorist suspects and breached the British Army’s rules of war. In support of his allegations, he has provided The Mail on Sunday with detailed descriptions of some of the most controversial killings in Northern Ireland’s recent history. A former British soldier claims he was part of an undercover unit which carried out a secret campaign against the IRA. Pictured is a soldier in Belfast during The Troubles. Cursey says these shootings were carried out by the Military Reaction Force (MRF), a clandestine Army team sent into Republican neighbourhoods to eliminate IRA gunmen. His accounts are being studied by detectives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland’s Historical Enquiries Team (HET), which was set up to re-examine suspicious deaths over the course of ‘The Troubles’. More than 2,260 cases are on its books. Cursey’s devastating disclosures include the claim that he never once cautioned a terror suspect or fired a warning shot before himself engaging with lethal force. He said he and his colleagues shot at least 20 men, though he could not say how many died. The revelations come a week after a damning report into the 1989 death of pro-Republican lawyer Pat Finucane that revealed shocking levels of collusion between British agents and Protestant paramilitaries. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Cursey defended the MRF’s tactics, insisting they were necessary given the dangers he and others faced. Even so, his recollections, revealed here for the first time, are likely to increase calls for a public inquiry into the actions of British Forces in Northern Ireland. He said: ‘We were mostly working alone or in pairs on the dim streets of Belfast. If I had given a warning I would have been as good as dead myself. The MRF was a counter-terrorist unit. How do you counter the terrorists? By terrorising them. The revelations come a week after a report into the death of pro-Republican lawyer Pat Finucane in 1989. ‘I have nothing to hide and no element of the MRF’s activities troubled me from a moral perspective. I’m aware the HET is looking into some of these incidents.

"This is the moment a Premier League star was arrested for drunkenly assaulting a police officer hours after playing Manchester United. West Ham defender, James Tomkins, 25, pleaded guilty to being drunk and disorderly outside the Sugar Hut nightclub in Brentwood, Essex. He also admitted assaulting and obstructing a police constable during the incident on December 21 and was fined £3,500 when he appeared at Southend Magistrates’ Court today. Scroll down for video. James Tomkins, West Ham defender, is arrested by police for being drunk and disorderly in Brentwood, Essex. Officers escort him to the police car, where he injured an officer. He was fined £3,500 for the assault. The footballer had been partying at the hotspot made famous by the ITV2 series The Only Way Is Essex hours after his club’s 3 – 1 defeat at Old Trafford. The court heard that Tomkins had been pushed hard by a member of staff but he admitted ‘over-reacting’. Martin Everett, chair of the bench at Southend Magistrates’ Court, told him that in the police car he dealt with the situation ‘inappropriately causing an injury to the police officer’. He added that ‘this is a blot on your character’ and he had ‘no doubt that West Ham will take their own action’ to punish him. The footballer pleaded guilty to all three charges when he appeared at Southend Magistrates' Court today. Mr Everett told him: ‘It is a late guilty plea but it has saved the court a trial and witnesses’. James Tomkins was spotted playing for his local Sunday League side at the age of seven and was signed to West Ham United’s youth academy. He started out his football career as a striker before switching to his current position in central defence. He has represented England internationally at U15, U16, U17, U19 and U21 levels and played every match of the 2008 UEFA U19 Championships. Tomkins made his Premier League debut on March 22, 2008 in a 1-1 draw away to Everton. In November 2008 he was signed to Derby County on a five week loan before he was recalled to West Ham on December 31. He played for Great Britain twice in the 2012 Olympics – in matches against Brazil and UAE. Rupert Bowers, defending, told the court that as a footballer he gets ‘a lot of attention - much of it unwanted’. He said: ‘They receive training and receive guidance from the Football Association. Mr Tomkins accepts that on this occasion he let himself down. ‘He has been extremely stressed about these proceedings, about his reputation and the coverage it has had.’ He also described Tomkins, who stood quietly in the dock during sentencing, as a ‘young man of previous good character [who is] usually looked up to.’ Tomkins, who was a former England Under-21 international and appeared for Team GB at the 2012 Olympics, was ordered to pay £3,785 court costs, £200 compensation to the police officer and a £120 victim surcharge.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- CNN President Jim Walton announced a major shakeup of CNN management Friday, replacing the head of CNN/US with a long-time CNN executive known for his business turn-around skills. HLN head Ken Jautz takes over as executive vice president of CNN/US, replacing Jonathan Klein, who headed the network for six years. CNN's chief marketing officer Scot Safon will run HLN, replacing Jautz. Walton also said he would hire a managing editor to ""help leverage our newsgathering resources across multiple platforms."" ""Ken is a rarity -- a working journalist who is an even better news executive,"" wrote Walton in a memo to staff. ""Ken has launched, made profitable and turned around businesses for our news organization, Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner literally around the world."" Jautz, who joined CNN in 1989 as a bureau chief in Germany, has held a wide variety of jobs at the company, including executive vice president in charge of CNN's business news operations. During a stint with Turner Broadcasting Europe, he helped launch channels in several European markets. Most recently, Jautz has presided over the revamp and rebranding of the HLN channel, introducing signature programs such as Nancy Grace, Joy Behar, ShowBiz Tonight, Issues with Jane Velez Mitchell and Morning Express with Robin Meade. The new evening line-up doubled the network's prime-time ratings. ""I look forward to working with CNN's many fine journalists and launching two new shows that I think will make our prime-time lineup more engaging and lively,"" Jautz said, ""and will continue CNN's strategy of delivering smart, informative news and analysis from across the political spectrum."" Safon takes over HLN after heading CNN's marketing for the last eight years, winning wide industry accolades for his marketing campaign for CNN and CNN=Politics. Before joining CNN, Safon oversaw marketing for one of CNN's sister channels, TNT. ""Scot is one of the most creative and passionate executives at Turner Broadcasting,"" said Walton. The moves come as CNN/US has suffered declining prime-time ratings in recent years as other cable channels have taken on partisan tones in their programming and news coverage. CNN/US recently announced a new prime-time lineup, hiring global media personality and former newspaper editor Piers Morgan to host an interview program to replace Larry King Live, and pairing Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Kathleen Parker and former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer in an 8 p.m. time slot. The memo sent to staff said Jonathan Klein is leaving CNN. During Klein's six years at CNN/US, the network won many awards for its aggressive coverage, including Hurricane Katrina, the South Asia tsunami, the 2008 U.S. elections and the devastating Haiti earthquake. ""Jon has made important contributions to the CNN story, and he leaves with our respect and friendship, and with my sincere thanks,"" Walton wrote to staff. Walton said that a search is under way for the new position of company-wide managing editor. The assignment for the new editor, Walton wrote to staff, is to generate ""the kind of front-page reporting and analysis that captures a news event, translates its meaning and shapes the dialogue about the story."" Phil Kent, CEO of Turner Broadcasting System, the parent company of CNN, also highlighted the role of the new managing editor position, saying it would ""build on the network's unique strengths in journalism and on CNN's quality editorial voice across all platforms.""

"(CNN) -- Remember ""You're money, baby""? Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau making the L.A. bar scene in ""Swingers"" back in 1996? In the film, couples go to the Eden Resort, which is offering a great package deal on relationship counseling. They were young and hungry then, and there was insolence in their hustle, but at least they pressed their case: They knew they were sharp enough to be players. Since then, Favreau has gone on to direct blockbusters like ""Elf"" and ""Iron Man,"" and his buddy Vaughn has stacked up a string of hits in the company of Frat Packers Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. Well, they're not hungry anymore, and not so young either. Between them (and with an assist from Dana ""What Happens in Vegas"" Fox), they have cooked up ""Couples Retreat,"" a marriage comedy that coincidentally doubles as an enviable excuse for an extended shoot in Bora Bora. Watch the stars talk about the shoot ». That's the tropical location of the Eden Resort, which is offering a great package deal for married couples looking for relationship counseling. Jason and Cynthia (Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell) want to give it a shot, and persuade their supposedly happily married friends Dave and Ronnie (Vaughn and Malin Akerman), Joey and Lucy (Favreau and Kristin Davis), and Shane and his 20-year-old girlfriend Trudy (Faizon Love and Kali Hawk) to join in the fun. Apparently, nobody has trouble raising the fare, even in these recessionary times. Once there, however, they are dismayed to find Eden is run with iron discipline, and the mandatory therapy sessions soon expose serious cracks in each of the relationships. Directed by Peter ""A Christmas Story"" Billingsley -- another old friend of Vaughn's -- ""Couples Retreat"" can't decide if it's satirizing New Age-y therapies or exploring marital breakdown. So it gives us a little of both, with some sub-Apatow sex humor on the side. As a commercial recipe, that's fine. America's ticket buyers have shown time and again they're desperate for a laugh and willing to overlook widespread mediocrity to get it. But you might hope for something a bit less lazy from this team. And shouldn't a movie with ""Couples"" in the title be less lopsided in its approach to the sexes? I guess in contrast to such boys-will-be-boys romps as ""The Hangover"" and ""Wild Hogs,"" at least this time the wives get to come along, not that any of them has much to say for herself. Trudy wants to party. Lucy has eyes for the yoga instructor (Carlos Ponce). Ronnie wants some romance. And Cynthia... I don't know what Cynthia wants, but getting away from her control freak husband certainly seems like the way to go. The guys are noticeably chubbier, but equally one-dimensional. It's just that that dimension enjoys rather more screen time as Billingsley indulges Vaughn and Favreau's less-than-inspired improvisational riffs on marital frustration, machismo and middle-age spread. We even have to endure a Guitar Hero duel. For a movie made by a bunch of friends, it's strange that we don't get any sense of how or why these couples hang out together.

A woman who made more than 250 time-wasting 999 calls, swearing at phone operators and even making a threat to kill, has narrowly avoided being given an anti-social behaviour order (Asbo). June Chadwick, 53, would ring the police when drunk and report crimes she had read about in the paper or seen on the television, a court heard. She was given a six-month community order with supervision, and ordered to pay £35 costs. In court: June Chadwick made more than 250 time-wasting 999 calls, swearing at phone operators and even making a threat to kill. Chadwick's calls to the emergency services each lasted between one and 18 minutes, Oldham Magistrates' Court was told. But a district judge turned down a request for her to be given an Asbo, which would have meant she faced jail if she made another time-wasting call. Threatening: June Chadwick was warned that she would be given an Asbo if she made another time-wasting call to the emergency services. Chadwick, of Falkirk Street, Greenacres, Oldham, admitted using the public communication network to cause annoyance, inconvenience and anxiety. She made the calls between August 2010. and October 2011. One of them, which was played to the court, included. swearing and a threat to kill. The court heard that Chadwick suffered from mild mental health issues and had delusional ideas. Chris Fallows, defending, said: 'Most of the calls were made because my client had a real concern that people in the UK were suffering and being killed by acts of violence. 'She had seen them on television and seen them in the paper and called the police. 'Her intention was to assist the police.' District Judge James Prowse said Chadwick’s condition would make it difficult for her to distinguish between a hoax and genuine call for help. But he warned that any further nuisance phone calls would see her almost certainly facing an Asbo. He told her: 'If it doesn’t stop, you’ll be back. 'If you carry on with these phone calls,. even if there is not a criminal prosecution, the court would certainly. make it (the order).' Chadwick's case was heard less than three weeks after another nuisance 999 caller avoided a jail sentence. Yasmin Adams, 21, who made more than 100 threatening 999 calls in only six days, told police she did it because she was 'bored' Another nuisance caller: Yasmin Adams, who made more than 100 threatening 999 calls in only six days, told police she did it because she was 'bored' She repeatedly warned call operators that she was going to'smash up' police cars and attack officers with pepper spray.

"Washington (CNN) -- The nation's airlines asked a federal court on Friday to stop the imminent furlough of air traffic controllers, saying the cuts could delay 6,700 flights daily with passengers waiting up to four hours in some cases. The Federal Aviation Administration is beginning the furloughs on Sunday as part of government-wide spending cuts that took effect in March due to inaction by Congress on a plan to cut the deficit. The FAA said the impact of the furloughs could be felt as early as Monday. Furloughs are hitting other agencies as well. While both sides agree furloughs would lead to substantial flight delays, the FAA and the airlines disagree on whether they are necessary. The FAA says it must furlough all 47,000 of its employees, including 15,000 air traffic controllers, as part of $637 million in planned spending cuts by September 30, the end of the government's fiscal year. The FAA's annual budget is $16 billion. ""We cannot avoid furloughs,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said this week. But the airlines said that step is ""based on a false legal premise -- that Congress has required the precise cuts that (the FAA has) ordered. However, the Budget Control Act does nothing of the sort,"" the airlines argued in court papers. The agency could cut elsewhere and spare the traveling public the acute pain it will feel when controllers stay home, the carriers said. The motion was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by Airlines for America, the trade association representing major airlines, the Regional Airline Association, and the Air Line Pilots Association, a group representing unionized pilots. They are challenging the FAA, which oversees air traffic operations and aviation safety in the United States, and its parent agency, the Transportation Department. The airlines said it would push for congressional legislation deeming air controllers ""essential"" employees, which would exempt them from furloughs. It has asked the Obama administration for a 30-day delay of its furlough action so it could pursue the matter with Congress.

This is the hilarious moment Boris Johnson gave as good as he got when a heckler cocked a snook at him. When faced with the gesture, more commonly found in school playgrounds, London Mayor quickly raised a thumb to his own nose and told protestors to ‘bog off’. He also faced cries of ‘Tory scum’ and ‘pleb’ as he went on a walkabout on dockyard but responded with a cry of 'lefty t*****s!' Scroll down for video. Schoolboy error: The protestor pretended to want to shake the London Mayor's hand, but quickly raised his thumb to his nose. Boris swiftly returned the favour. Boris Johnson gave as good as he got on a walkabout in Bristol, cocking a snook at a protestor.

"By. Martin Robinson. A new ban on cheap alcohol is already failing because high-strength booze is still being sold for less than a bottle of water, experts said today. Since Monday retailers have been unable to sell lager or cider. for less than 50p a can after ministers promised a new minimum pricing regime to end the ‘worst examples of harmful drink’. Shops in Blackpool, Britain's worst town for alcohol-related illnesses and deaths, are selling cans of 7.5 per cent strength cider for 89p, while bottled water on their shelves is the same price or more. Row: Omega strong cider is being sold for 89p a can at Buy Low bargains in Blackpool, right,. Although this 89p price is above the new threshold, shocked health officials have said that David Cameron should already re-think his policy to save lives. An investigation has found that at least. three shops in the seaside resort sold high-strength cans of cider or lager for. less or the same price as a bottle of water. Buy Low Bargains, close to the pier, sells Omega Cider for 89p. Its. manager Sam Meak defended the policy and said: 'They are alcoholics so. they don’t mind if they buy it cheap or whatever, they would buy the. cider if it was £20'. The seaside resort is Britain's poorest and most deprived in terms of income, employment and health problems. Alcohol. is widely blamed and in the past two years 2,914 people were admitted. to hospital with alcohol-related illnesses and 140 died - the highest. figures by population in Britain. The town's Victoria Hospital says it has seen an increase in the number of people being rushed there in alcohol-induced comas or liver failure. NHS Blackpool's alcohol lead Steve Morton said: 'Minimum prices. would have minimal effect on the average person – something like 12p a. week – but it would deter young vulnerable people from buying cheap,. strong alcohol. 'High strength, low cost alcohol tends to be. drunk by people with an alcohol problem and younger people who want to. get as much alcohol as cheaply as possible because they have limited. means. 'Minimum prices need to come in through legislation, but. in the mean time responsible traders should be looking at stopping. selling strong alcohol. The industry needs to take some. responsibility – a dead customer is no customer at all'. Admissions: By population more people are taken Blackpool's Victoria Hospital with alcohol-related illnesses than anywhere else in Britain. Blackpool's public health chief, Dr Arif Rajpura, has called on David Cameron to rethink minimum pricing to save lives. Under his original plans a can of lager would have retailed for £1.56, wine for £4.22 and spirits for £12.60. But the Prime Minister faced strong opposition from within the Cabinet, as ministers warned it could unfairly hit responsible drinkers on lower incomes. So the Prime Minister’s proposal – which would have fixed the cost of a unit of alcohol at 45p – was dumped last summer. Instead cans must be at least 50p each, bottles of wine £2.24 and 750ml bottles of vodka or whisky £10.16. The new system works by banning shops and pubs from selling alcohol at less than the total cost of the duty payable to the Treasury, plus VAT. But experts say it will have a minimal effect. On average, each adult is expected to drink just 0.04 per cent less over the course of the year. So-called ‘hazardous drinkers’ – those who consume more than the recommend safe limits – are</s>",Since Monday shops must sell cans of lager or cider for at least 50p each. A shop in Blackpool is selling super-strength cider for 89p. While it is above the new threshold it is still less than a bottle of water.

"Billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen has been unmasked as the secret lone bidder who shelled out $101million for a sculpture by Alberto Giacometti at a New York City auction last week. Sources familiar with the details of the sale told local media outlets, among them Page Six, that Cohen, the founder of the now-defunct investment firm SAC Capital Advisors, scooped up the masterpiece titled 'Chariot' last Tuesday at Sotheby's impressionist and modern art sale. The rare 1951 bronze sculpture, one of only six created by Giacometti, features an elongated goddess-like figure perched atop a wheeled chariot. Billionaire's newest toy: Hedge fund manager Steve cohen (left) reportedly bought Alberto Giacometti's 'Chariot' sculpture (right) for $101million at auction November 4. Stunner: The rare 1951 bronze sculpture, one of only six created by Giacometti, features an elongated goddess-like figure perched atop a wheeled chariot. The sculpture had been in the collection of Alexander Goulandris, a Greek shipping magnate, since 1972. The price paid by Cohen was just shy of breaking the $104.3million record for the Swiss artist. The sculpture had been in the collection of Alexander Goulandris, a Greek shipping magnate, since 1972. Mr Cohen's big-ticket purchase comes a year after he was forced to pay record-setting $1.8billion to settle criminal insider trading charges. The scandal led to the closing of SAC Capital, but Cohen has since opened a new outfit called Point72 Asset Management, which mostly handles the billionaire's own fortune. The family firm has posted impressive gains of 15 per cent as of the end of last month. Cohen, 58, is widely considered to be one of the most successful hedge fund managers of all times. Defunct: Cohen's highly successful SAC Capital hedge fund was forced to pay record-setting $1.8billion to settle criminal insider trading charges last year. The firm has since closed down. House worthy of a king: Steve Cohen and his wife, Alexandra, reside in a palatial compound sitting on more than 18 acres of land in tony Greenwich, Connecticut. Pleasuredome: The estate comes with a 35,000-square-foot main house, a full-size indoor basketball court, a 6,700-square-foot ice skating rink, and even a small golf course. With a personal net worth of $10.3billion at his disposal, he has been heavily investing in art, amassing one of the most remarkable collections in the US valued at over $1billion. Ms Cohen's legal complications evidently have done nothing to curb his appetite for masterpieces. While SAC Capital was being investigated for insider trading by the US Department of Justice in 2012, Mr Cohen paid Las Vegas casino tycoon Steve Wynn $155million for Pablo Picasso's La Reve. The painting had to undergo restoration following a notorious 2006 mishap in which Mr Wynn accidentally put his elbow through the canvass, opening a six-inch gash, just before it was set to be shipped to Cohen. Steve Cohen, who is married and lives in Greenwich, Connecticut, also owns a Jackson Pollack and Damien Hirst's 1991 famed shark sculpture, which he purchased a decade ago for $8million, according to multiple reports. The large-scale work featuring a tiger shark in formaldehyde had been on loan until 2010 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

"Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Members of a Colombian leftist rebel group released two more longtime prisoners Wednesday afternoon, bringing the total released since February 9 to six, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by the Spanish acronym FARC, freed Police Maj. Guillermo Solorzano and Army Cpl. Salin Antonio Sanmiguel Valderrama on Wednesday afternoon in a rural area located in the departments of Cauca and Valley of the Cauca in southwest Colombia, the Red Cross said in a news release. Solorzano had spent three years and eight months in captivity; Sanmiguel had been held for two years and eight months, it said. Both men were handed over to former Sen. Piedad Cordoba, ICRC representatives and a member of the group Colombian Men and Women for Peace, the Red Cross said. The freed men were being taken to the city of Cali in a helicopter donated by the government of Brazil. From there, they were to travel to Bogota to reunite with their families. ""It pleases us that the relatives can be with their loved ones whom they have been waiting for for a long time,"" said Christophe Beney, the International Red Cross's chief in Colombia. ""We are very satisfied that, in the end, the agreements assumed by the sides, as much by the Colombian government as by the FARC, have been carried out."" With the handover, the number of people freed by the FARC since February 9 rises to six, the Red Cross said. The releases came three days after an initial attempt to retrieve the hostages failed when coordinates for their location proved to be inaccurate.

"While Saint Patrick's Day has long been the preserve of Guinness-drinking revellers painting the world's towns green while wearing shamrock hats, Irish Catholics have always taken pride in their nation's patron saint. Now a new study from Cambridge University based on his writings suggests Saint Patrick was not brought to Ireland as a slave, as the legend has it, but that in fact he may actually have sold slaves his family owned to pay his way to Ireland -- in order to avoid a job as a tax collector for the Roman empire. The findings fly in the face of the classic account of the life of Saint Patrick, who grew up as a member of the Roman nobility in western Britain and was supposedly abducted and forced into slavery in Ireland around 400 A.D. According to this history, Patrick escaped and became a priest before having a vision and returning to Ireland to convert the Irish to Christianity. Legend has it Saint Patrick used the shamrock, now the national emblem of Ireland, to explain the concept of the Holy Trinity, by showing an unbeliever the three-leafed plant with one stalk. The new study, based on Patrick's own writings in their historical context, argues that Patrick actually ended up in Ireland in order to avoid becoming a ""Decurion,"" or Roman tax collector -- a role in city government that had become undesirable and dangerous in Patrick's time. ""In the troubled era in which Patrick lived, which saw the demise and eventual collapse of Roman government in Britain in 410, discharging the obligations of a Decurion, especially tax-collecting, would not only have been difficult but also very risky,"" said Dr. Roy Flechner, from the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic at Cambridge University. Patrick's father was a Decurion, which was a hereditary role, and when he vacated his position in order to join the clergy, Flechner says Patrick chose to leave Britain to avoid being obligated to take up his father's job. In order to get to Ireland, which lacked a monetary system at the time, Patrick would have needed to sell commodities to finance the trip. According to his writings, Patrick's family owned several slaves -- a high value and easily transportable commodity -- and Flechner says in the historical context it makes sense that Patrick would convert his family wealth into slaves he could sell in order to pay his way. But Philip Freeman, author of the biography ""St. Patrick of Ireland,"" says while it is almost certain that Patrick's family owned slaves, as many members of the Roman nobility did at the time, experts' claims that Patrick himself was a slave trader is reading too far into the sources. ""It's almost certain that Patrick grew up surrounded by slaves, but there's no good reason for thinking he was a slave trader,"" Freeman told CNN. ""The only sources we have about Patrick that are really reliable are the two letters he wrote when he was an old man,"" he said. ""And both of those tell the story of a young man who grew up in the young Roman nobility in Britain, but was kidnapped when he was 16 years old."" Cambridge University's Roy Flechner believes the widely accepted history of Saint Patrick's early life and kidnapping was largely concocted by Patrick himself in those letters. ""The traditional story that Patrick was kidnapped from Britain, forced to work as a slave, but managed to escape and reclaim his status, is likely to be fiction: the only way out of slavery in this period was to be redeemed, and Patrick was never redeemed. The traditional legend was instigated by Patrick himself in the letters he wrote,</s>","St. Patrick's Day is the feast day St. Patrick, patron saint of Ireland. Study: Patrick may have sold slaves in order to pay his way to Ireland to avoid tax collector job in Britain. Traditional history says Patrick was abducted in Britain and taken to Ireland as a slave.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- On their son's last night as president, a melancholy former President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, made an impromptu visit to the White House's press briefing room and told reporters how much they'll miss the building. Ex-President George H.W. Bush says he'll miss coming and going from the White House. ""We will miss coming and going, but it's time to move on,"" said the former president, who was a frequent visitor during his son's two terms in office. ""The Bushes are going to a happy life."" When a reporter suggested that perhaps one of their other sons, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, will take the White House someday, the former president smiled. ""Maybe Jeb will do something. I'd like to see him try,"" the former president said. Barbara Bush, who was first lady from 1989 to 1993, said the hardest part of the night was saying goodbye to the White House residence staff a second time. ""In tears twice,"" she said, her eyes red. She added that she and her husband are looking forward to attending Tuesday's inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama. ""Very exciting day,"" she said.

"Those who fear 3D-printed plastic guns take note: a Tennessee man has demonstrated that a deadly firearm can also be made completely out of items available from airport retail stores. Web developer Evan Booth of Greensboro, North Carolina moonlights as a'security expert' and can make projectile weapons with things like hairdryers and Axe body spray--all of which you can get after you make it through security. While he has an airport crossbow, blowgun, and spiked club, it's Booth's hand-built gun--which he calls his BLUNDERBUSiness Class--that seems most worrisome. Scroll down for video demo. Scary: Evan Booth of Greensboro hosts a website where he demonstrates how to make, among other things, a gun (pictured) out of items available for purchase in airport terminals past the security checkpoint. ‘I think people have kind of been suspecting that the type of things I’ve built are possible,’ Booth tells Fast Company. ‘I just don’t think anyone’s ever taken the time to do it.’ Booth, who attended East Tennessee State University and earned a degree in digital media, says he embarked on the startling project after airports began to introduce body scanners. ‘It just seemed so invasive, really expensive,’ he said. ‘And if you’re going to go through all that trouble getting into the terminal, why is all this stuff available in the terminal?’ To Booth, whose speaking engagements include hacker conferences across America and abroad, that stuff equaled a disturbing possibility. Ingenious: Booth says he got the idea to when he realized he could buy lithium batteries, which cause a hot chemical reaction when combined with water. 'If I wanted to build something very potent, I would probably go toward lithium,' he says. Aromatic: The lithium and water create enough heat to blow up a 1oz can of Axe body spray. So he began tinkering with the range of seemingly innocuous items available in airport shops that line the terminals on the wrong side of security. And he found that not only was he able to create a gun, but he could also make a range of potentially deadly weapons, all of which he demonstrates on his website Terminal Cornucopia. ‘If we're trying stop a terrorist threat at the airport,’ says Booth. ‘It's already too late.’ KERPOW! The can of Axe body spray explodes in a cloud of fire. Serious business: Using a handful of change as the projectile, the gun Booth dubs a BLUNDERBUSiness Class blows a hole larger than a quarter in a drywall target. Moonlighting: Evan Booth works with computers by day but calls himself a'security researcher' by night, which is when he tinkers with his airport weapons at his home in North Carolina. The idea for his BLUNDERBUSiness gun came. to him after he realized airports sell lithium batteries. When mixed. with water, that lithium can create enough heat to turn a can of Axe. body spray into aromatic ammunition. Combine it with a hollowed out hair dryer, some gossip magazines and other sundries and you’ve got yourself a gun. ‘Right now if I wanted to build something very potent, I would probably go toward lithium,’ says Booth.

"By. Alexandra Klausner. PUBLISHED:. 16:43 EST, 16 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 09:31 EST, 17 November 2013. Seven cases of meningitis occurred recently on Princeton University's college campus in New Jersey. School Officials are meeting with the trustees this weekend to discuss whether or not to administer students a vaccination. The vaccination in question is the only Meningococcal that prevents against meningitis group B. The Novartis manufactured vaccination called, Bexsero, may be used in Europe and Australia but has not yet been approved in the United States. Princeton will decide whether or not to administer students a meningitis vaccination that has not yet been approved in the United States. Elizabeth powers, a spokesperson for Novartis said they are working with the Centers for Disease Control and the state Department of Public Health in order to get a vaccine for the school. 'We have filed an Investigational New Drug application for our MenB vaccine in the U.S., but have not yet come to an agreement on a pathway to licensure for this vaccine with regulatory authorities,' Novartis spokeswoman Elizabeth Power told CNN. Martin Mbuga, a spokesman for the Ivy League School, said that the school is working to eradicate the problem as safely as possible. Bexsero is the only vaccine that prevents against the rare type of meningitis B that already infected seven people, one of whom is still hospitalized. The school has been telling students to keep washing their hands, not to share drinks, and to always cover their coughs, reported USA Today. Group B meningitis is a bacterial strain that causes symptoms such as fever, vomiting, stiff neck, headache, confusion, and sensitivity to light. It is characterized as a swelling of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. If left untreated it can cause permanent brain damage, hearing loss, and lead to limb amputations and death. It can be treated with antibiotics. The type of meningitis spreading over the campus is a very rare form that usually only affects children. A professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, William Schaffner, told USA Today that 'Usually, when you see this kind of meningitis on the campus, it's meningitis C,"" he said. 'This is very, very unusual.' CNN reported that the first case occurred after a student returned to Campus in March after Spring recess. Two months later, six more students and a visitor contracted the disease. Most of the students recovered except for one student who is currently hospitalized after being diagnosed on Nov.8. The Mail Online got the chance to speak to Dr. Daryl Isaacs, an expert in preventative medicine, clinical diagnosis, and travel medicine. He is currently on staff at New York University School of Medicine, Beth Israel Medical Center, and New York Downtown Hospital. He was also featured as the doctor in the popular film, 'SuperSize Me.' Meningitis is spread by exchanging saliva, sharing drinks, or other respiratory secretions. He told the Mail Online, 'All students should get vaccinated before going to college.' 'It's a disease caused by overcrowding,' he said. 'It spreads anywhere there are people such as in dormitories, cafeterias, and prisons.' He also emphasized the dangers of the disease and called it, 'rapidly spreading and highly fatal.' As for whether or not the school should administer the vaccination to its students, he said 'absolutely.' He said most college students are required to be vaccinated before arriving on campus and if students opt out of the</s>",Seven cases of a rare form of meningitis B occurred at Princeton University.

"Mother of collaboration: Lady Lucile Duff-Gordon invented collaborations with her 1916 collection for Sears, Roebuck & Co. Phillip Lim sparked a retail frenzy this past weekend with his ode to cheap clothes at Target. But while the collection may have disappeared from store shelves, the concept of design collaborations has deeper roots than fast fashion may imply. The institution was actually started in London in 1916 by Titanic survivor Lady Lucile Duff-Gordon, whose couture house Lucile changed the landscape of fashion for the modern era. While little-known outside of fashion historian circles, Lady Duff-Gordon’s contributions to the fashion industry far exceed her limited notoriety. The house of Lucile, revered for its feminine Edwardian glamour, defined the era’s aesthetic with clothes that overflowed with frills, florals, and sweet colors. It was the go-to label for British aristocracy, as well as gentries in the United States and France. But Lucile was not simply just a purveyor of hyper feminine clothes. It was a game-changer in the realms of fashion business practices, as well as marketing. Lady Duff-Gordon (who often went by Lucile, professionally) created the first-ever designer collaboration with a two-season run for Sears, Roebuck & Co. She was also one of the first designers to stage runway shows, release a branded perfume, and issue coupons in magazines as a way to draw customers into her handful of international boutiques. Lucile was founded in 1893 according to Randy Bryan Bigham, author of the self-published book Lucile- Her Life by Design, as a way to support herself in the aftermath of her first marriage. Lady Duff-Gordon built Lucile’s name on attention-grabbing antics. She was the first designer to utilize celebrity culture as a method for attracting public recognition. Lady Duff-Gordon’s sister, the novelist and film producer Elinor Glyn, offered the designer an inside track to famous entertainers and the more renowned members of the Ziegfeld Follies, whom she dressed in a time when performers were still considered painted lady-type figures. Haute couture: Lucile's designs epitomized the Belle Époque era's hyper feminine aesthetic and overflowed with frills, florals, and sweet colors. Lady Duff-Gordon’s many publicity stunts. earned her label a certain sense of notoriety—one which was tempered by. her lofty social title, which she earned in her second marriage to. Scottish landowner and Olympic fencer Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon. ‘How she presented herself went a long way in the business, the whole idea that she was aristocratic allowed her to be so suggestive,’ said Beth Dincuff, a fashion history professor at Parsons, The New School for Design. It also paved her foray into the lingerie industry—a move that is well marked with cultural transgressions. While Lady Duff-Gordon did not reinvent lingerie garments, she did revolutionize underpinnings by ushering the then-utilitarian objects into the decorative arena. Her undergarments were sold out of a boudoir in her atelier named The Rose Room, an environment where women were meant to feel comfortable shopping for lingerie with risqué style names like 'Dawn's Gentle Whisper'. She also named her ready-to-wear designs with monikers like ‘Climax’ and ‘The Garden of Love’. Famous fans: Lucile often created custom designs for performers, including famous members of the Ziegfeld follies, making</s>","Lady Lucile Duff-Gordon's high-end label Lucile created two collections for Sears, Roebuck & Co.

"(Budget Travel) -- The following five sites have proven the most consistently useful for the editors of Budget Travel, who do thousands of searches a year. Budget Travel editors reveal favorite online resources to book flights, hotels and other needs. Dohop.com. Strictly for booking plane trips entirely outside of the U.S., such as a flight between Paris and Rome. The site runs simultaneous searches of multiple airports serving the same city -- five airports in London, for instance -- and it retrieves fares from no-frills independent carriers like EasyJet and Ryanair, which many better-known travel sites overlook. That said, be warned that Dohop doesn't work nearly as well for booking airfares leaving the U.S. Kayak.com. The all-time best site for finding the cheapest plane tickets in the U.S. Our biggest beef with Kayak's competitors is that when you click to book a fare, they typically direct you to a new page. Sometimes it's only then that you find out your actual departure time -- or worse, you're forced to plug in your dates and departure cities all over again, only to discover far different results. Kayak stands apart. Once you've found a good flight on Kayak, click on the price and you'll be sent directly to the airline's Web site, where the exact price for the exact flight you selected unfailingly appears. Another perk: If you are flexible on your travel dates, we recommend you try Kayak's flexible-date search tool, which covers the broadest scope of routes and airports of any site we've tested. Budget Travel: Staying in touch while on the road. Priceline.com. The granddaddy discounter helps hotels, car-rental agencies, and airlines unload all sorts of inventory at well below published prices. We admit that Priceline's name-your-own-price option -- in which travelers don't know specific details until after their bids have been accepted -- isn't for everyone. But as flexible travelers, we're fans of using Priceline to bid blindly. You'll find the best results when bidding for upscale hotels in large cities, paying up to half off what other guests pay. The trade-off is that your hotel's location will be something of a surprise. But in many big cities, it doesn't really matter which neighborhood you're staying in, because you're hopping all over town sightseeing anyway. Of course, Priceline also sells travel the straightforward way (with the price and details quoted up-front), but, in our opinion, it's no better at doing that than Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz or CheapTickets. TripAdvisor.com. Harnessing the power of the masses, the user-hotel-review site TripAdvisor is the top way to hunt for hotels. We admit that the site's spectrum of good, bad and mixed reviews for the same property can be confusing. But you know what? After reading the reviews and disregarding ones that seem off or biased, you get a decent sense of what to expect in a hotel -- which is the point.

"(CNN) -- Wang Yue, the two-year-old girl who was left for dead on a narrow street in southern China after a hit-and-run accident, has died. The toddler, nicknamed Yueyue, had been cared for in a hospital in Guangdong province since she was injured a week ago. She succumbed to severe injuries Friday morning. Two hit-and-run drivers ran over Yueyue, one after another, after she wandered into the alley outside her father's hardware store. Both fled the scene but are now under arrest. But there was one thing more shocking than the double hit-and-run: the seeming apathy by pedestrians, cyclists and drivers—18 of them—who did not stop to help. Yueyue laid motionless in the street for 10 minutes until Chen Xianmei, a 58-year-old woman who collects trash for a living, passed by. She moved her to safety and called for help. A security camera captured the incident on tape. After the video was posted online, Yueyue's plight prompted sympathy, outrage and debate in and outside China. How could 18 people pass by the critically injured child and do nothing? The incident has also prompted widespread soul-searching in China about the state of the nation's morality and civic-consciousness. Why is it so difficult for Chinese nowadays to be a Good Samaritan? There are many possible explanations and many possible culprits. Some blame it on the lack of laws and regulations. Others argue it's caused by the failure of China's education system to inculcate respect for human life and dignity. Still others blame it on what some call ""jingshen kongxu"", or spiritual vacuum. As the country's 1.3 billion people compete to make money and climb the economic and social ladder, experts say, many people find themselves spiritually adrift. Reynard Hing, an astute China-watcher, cautions against making sweeping conclusions. ""It's funny how many people read into this, to the point that anti-Chinese sentiment arises,"" he wrote me. ""This situation is not unique to China."" He cites the case of Kitty Genovese. In 1964, the woman in Queens, N.Y. was chased and stabbed to death by an assailant over the course of half an hour while 38 of her neighbors watched from their windows and did nothing to help. Psychologists, Hing tells me, have dubbed this phenomenon the 'bystander problem'—the one factor that would predict Good Samaritan behavior was how many witnesses there were to a tragic event: The more bystanders, the less likely someone will step up to help. I asked Xia Xueluan, a socio-psychology professor at Peking University, about the seeming callousness of the 18 passersby. One factor is the district where it occurred, which has a concentration of hardware stores like the one Yueyue's father owns. ""(They) are owners of hardware stores originally from different parts of China who hardly know each other. Together they comprise a'strangers' society', instead of one made up of real friends and acquaintances, or the ""acquaintances' society'."" Xia said the two sub-groups are fundamentally different. ""In an 'acquaintances' society',"" he explained, ""their relationship is of intimacy, trust and interdependence. In the'strangers' society' it is characterized by estrangement, distrust, and independence. In such a society, it is not surprising to see incidents like this.""

Rules in place for a decade allow ministers to act to revoke passports in a bid to target the so-called ‘enemy within’. Two men stripped of their British citizenship in 2010 - Bilal al-Berjawi and Mohamed Sak - had links to Somalia's al-Shabaab militant (pictured) The Home Office today defended the policy from claims it was equivalent to ‘medieval exile’, insisting the British citizenship was ‘a privilege not a right’. Officials said that from 2002 to September last year 20 citizens were stripped of their passports. A report by the Bureaux for Investigative Journalism, published in The Independent today, suggested the number is 21, of which only two have successfully appealed. At least five of the 16 to lose their citizenship under the coalition were born in Britain, the report said. One man had lived in the UK for five decades. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Citizenship is a privilege not a right. The Home Secretary has the power to remove citizenship from individuals where she considers it is conducive to the public good. An individual subject to deprivation can appeal to the courts.’ Home Secretary Theresa May, who has revoked 16 passports since 2010, insists British citizenship is a privilege not a right. However, concern has been expressed that after losing British citizenship suspects have been targeted, and in some cases killed, in US drone attacks. Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader, is to write to Mrs May about the scale of the threat posed to Britain. ‘There was clearly always a risk when the law was changed seven years ago that the executive could act to take citizenship away in circumstances that were more frequent or more extensive than those envisaged by ministers at the time,’ Mr Hughes told The Independent. Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes is demanding the powers be reviewed. ‘I’m concerned at the growing number of people who appear to have lost their right to citizenship. I plan to write to the Home Secretary and the Home Affairs Select Committee to ask for their assessment of the situation, and for a review of whether the act is working as intended.’ Two men involved - Bilal al-Berjawi, a British-Lebanese citizen, and British-born friend Mohamed Sakr, who also held Egyptian nationality – travelled to Somalia in 2009. They are said to have become involved with Islamist militant group al-Shabaab, which has links to al-Qa’ida. Both rose to senior positions in the organisation. They were stripped of their British nationalities by Mrs May in 2010 and were killed in separate US airstrikes. Saghir Hussain, Sakr’s former UK solicitor said: ‘It appears that the process of deprivation of citizenship made it easier for the US to then designate Mr Sakr as an enemy combatant, to whom the UK owes no responsibility whatsoever.’ Gareth Peirce, a leading human rights lawyer, said the use of the powers ‘smacked of medieval exile, just as cruel and just as arbitrary’.

"By. Emma Reynolds and Ian Sparks. PUBLISHED:. 09:46 EST, 20 September 2012. |. UPDATED:. 01:33 EST, 21 September 2012. The photographer who took the topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge is British, it was claimed today. French paparazzo Pascal Rostain said the the Royal couple were staked out at the chateau while on their holiday by an Englishman living in the south of France. Mr Rostain also sensationally claimed that the photographer was spying on them on the orders of France's Closer magazine, which was first to publish 13 intimate images of Kate and William last week. Scroll down for video. The pictures originally published in French Closer magazine, left, are appearing in a Swedish magazine today and 60 will be printed in Denmark's Se & Hoer magazine tomorrow. William and Kate have won a court order banning French Closer from selling or republishing the photographs, under the threat of a 100,000 euro fine. The news comes as a Swedish magazine today published the pictures and Danish magazine Se Og Hor (See And Hear) prepared to reproduce over 60 photos tomorrow in a 16-page supplement. Mr Rostain, in his 40s, is a close friend of former French First Lady Carla Bruni and one of France's most notorious long lens photographers. Denial: If true, the claim would exonerate French photographer Valerie Suau, who claims she took bikini photos of Kate but not topless ones. He told France Metro newspaper in Lyon: 'The irony of this whole thing is that the photographer who took these pictures is an Englishman living in the south of France. 'These photos were taken on the orders of Closer, who asked him to sit around for several days to take them. 'For his efforts he did not earn a lot. He could have sold them for 10,000 euros. 'But in fact he was just paid his wages for going to take them. 'He didn't put them on the open market either, where he could have earned a lot more.' Another French photographer outside the Chateau d'Autet where the snaps were taken was a French woman named Valerie Suau - nicknamed The Sewer because of the pronunciation of her surname. She has admitted taking pictures of Kate in her bikini, but said she does not know who took the topless photos. The Royal couple this week won a landmark injunction preventing further distribution of the images by Closer, under the threat of a 100,000 euro fine. They have also handed over all files containing the images to representatives of the couple on the orders of the judge, after they were ruled a 'brutal' invasion of privacy. The court made no ruling for the magazine to name the photographer, however, and it has the right to protect his or identity under France's laws on protection of journalistic sources. Meanwhile a criminal investigation is under way to find and prosecute the photographer - who could face a year in jail and a £36,000 fine. X marks the spot: The long lens pictures taken of the topless Duchess were shot from the side of the road between trees around half a mile away from the chateau. Yet the photos are still being touted on the open market worldwide, with magazines in Italy, Denmark and Sweden all publishing them. Closer published 13 grainy images of Kate's breasts and bottom last Thursday, branded 'grotesque and unjustifiable' by a Royal spokesman. Mr Rostain did not specifically say he knew the identity of Kate's photographer, but is known to be very well connected among the French paparazzi community. He defended the person who took them, adding: 'As a photographer, I take the pictures I</s>",He said photographer was 'just paid his wages' and could have earned a lot more on the open market.

"By. Anucyia Victor for MailOnline. Celebrities are infamous for their demanding ways and bad behaviour, and nowhere is this more apparent than when they splash out on a stay at a hotel. Lindsay Lohan is infamous for her shenanigans at Shutters on the Beach Hotel in Santa Monica, California but her antics were overshadowed by Charlie Sheen's escapades at The Plaza Hotel in New York, which reportedly cost him $7,000 (£4,000) in damages,. From Lilo's exorbitant unpaid hotel bills to Florence setting a hotel room on fire, these celebs prove that fame can sometimes go their heads. Scroll down for video. According to sources, Lindsay Lohan's notorious antics have got her blacklisted from nine hotels in the States. Sternly worded letter: Lindsay was asked to remove her belongings immediately and told to return the hotel's laptop. Amanda Bynes. The troubled Amanda Bynes has had a rough time of it but things are looking up for the child star. Recently released from a Malibu rehab centre, Bynes is working hard to get her life back on track. But things were far from rosy last year when the starlet was kicked out of the £422-a-night Ritz-Carlton Central Park. Her crime? The actress had allegedly insulted hotel staff, trashed her room, and she reportedly smoked marijuana then tried to spray chemicals to get rid of the smell. Troubled star Amanda Bynes was kicked out of Ritz-Carlton Central Park for bad behaviour. Charlie Sheen caused over £4,000 of damages to his suite at New York's Plaza Hotel. The star allegedly locked his girlfriend in a closet. Charlie Sheen. The actor has been in and out of the press for bad behaviour, and in 2010 the former Two and a Half Men star caused over $7,000 (£4,200) in damages to his suite at The Plaza Hotel, New York. It was claimed the 48-year-old – who entered rehab in January 2011 – stripped to his underwear and wrecked his luxury suite. All this while his girlfriend was screaming in a locked closet. According to the actor's representative, the star was having a bad reaction to medication, which caused his untoward behaviour. The lead singer of Florence and the Machine boozed up on cocktails with celeb pal Kanye West and accidentally set her hotel room at the Bowery Hotel (right) on fire. Florence Welch. The flame-haired siren of Florence and the Machine has come clean about her scandalous behaviour at New York's Bowery Hotel in 2012. The singer confessed to Q Magazine that, after a night of boozing it up with Kanye West and Lykke Li, she woke up to find that 'half the room was singed.' I think I must have had about 17 Dirty Martinis,' she said. 'I lost my phone and ripped my dress very badly. I accidentally set fire to The Bowery Hotel because I'd left a cinnamon tea light burning. 'I came back to the hotel, passed out in my ripped dress — no phone, chipped tooth — came round and there was black stuff all over the wall, my book had melted on the bedside table and there was a bucket of water on the floor.'

Williams, who has rediscovered some of her best form in the build up to the final grand slam of the season, looked down and out as she lost an error-strewn opening set. But there were cheers from the crowd on Arthur Ashe court when the 34-year-old home favorite won her first game of the match at the start of the second. It looked like a phoenix from the flames comeback was on from Williams as she overpowered Errani to level at one set all. The third set saw the pendulum of momentum swing between the two players. Williams was serving for the match at 5-3 up only for Errani to break back and eventually force a deciding tiebreak. The breaker was another see-sawing affair but it was the Italian who conjured some brilliant play to wrap up it 7-5 and book her place in the fourth round. Williams came into Friday's single match on the back off a draining doubles match with her sister Serena.

"By. Kerry Mcqueeney. PUBLISHED:. 08:34 EST, 21 August 2012. |. UPDATED:. 11:52 EST, 21 August 2012. Simon Land (pictured) admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. A man battered his pet cat with an iron bar after it jumped on him and sunk its claws into his back in a 'wildlife programme'-style attack, a court has been told. Simon Land beat the cat with a 3ft-long bar after the animal mauled him as he tried to move it from his bedroom. The three-year-old animal's injuries were so severe that vets had to put her down. After the attack, Land, 43, called 999 in a desperate bid to save the ginger-and-white cat Mia. Despite RSPCA inspectors racing the animal to a vet in a shopping trolley to get her emergency treatment, she had to be put to sleep, a court was told. Land was arrested and, during an appearance at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court yesterday, he admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. He was banned from keeping animals for five years and ordered to pay £250 in court costs. Land suffered scratches as a result of being attacked by Mia, magistrates said. Charles Overton, chairman of the bench, told Land: 'The aggravating factor is the cat died as a result of a weapon.' Land, who had bought the cat from a woman on the internet, revealed how the cat had attacked him at his home in Congleton, Cheshire, on the night of January 24. He told the court he knew Mia was a 'problem cat' but was determined to look after her. He claimed he found Mia behind his wardrobe and tried to remove her from his bedroom because it was a cold night and he wanted to close the door. Beyond rescue: The horrific injury Simon Land inflicted on his pet cat Mia when he hit her with an iron bar. During a hearing at Macclesfield Magistrates Court (pictured), Land was banned from keeping animals for five years. Andrew Meachin, prosecuting, said: 'He said he went to get her out and she went into a frenzy. 'She was jumping all over him and he couldn’t get her off him. 'He said he had only seen something like that in wildlife programmes.' After beating the cat off, Land took a shower before dialling 999 and begging the police for help. Mr Meachin added: 'Land stated that he had just got out of the shower as he had been covered in blood and he had called the police as he didn’t know what to do. 'No reasonable person would pick up a metal bar and hit a cat - there is no justification' 'When asked what had happened he stated that his cat, Mia, had attacked him and, to get her off, he hit her with an iron bar. 'When asked where Mia was, he pointed to underneath the settee. 'The officers saw a small, white and ginger cat cowering underneath and it was clear the cat had a severe injury to its right eye, which was very swollen and blood-red.' Despite desperate attempts to save the cat, a vet put her to sleep after ruling her injuries were too severe. Julian Farley, defending, told the court Land acted in self defence.

"Mariella Frostrup has urged parents to be aware of the danger of online paedophiles when buying tablets or smartphones for Christmas. They are now must-have gifts for many children. But Mariella Frostrup has urged parents to be aware of the danger of online paedophiles when buying electronic devices such as tablets or smartphones for Christmas as they provide youngsters with access to a risky ‘unknown universe’. The presenter, 52, revealed her fears for her daughter Molly, 10, and son Danny, eight, as they begin using social media. Despite their young age they both have tablet computers. And Miss Frostrup, who is married to their father, human rights lawyer Jason McCue, 43, said she has been left checking their devices every night, after hearing stories from her friends about their children being targeted on sites such as Instagram. Miss Frostrup, who presents the Radio 4 programme Open Book, said: ‘I like to think of myself as a liberal, not driven to heights of hysteria by prevailing media headlines, but when it comes to the sexualisation of our children and the predatory presence of paedophiles I’m starting to feel the fear. ‘A friend emailed me the other night to say she’d deleted her daughter’s Instagram account after finding, among 70 or so school friends in a supposedly private stream, the profiles of three grown men who displayed disturbing enthusiasm for her photos of 10-year-olds.’ Earlier this year Miss Frostrup also learned of another friend’s teenage son’s ordeal after being targeted on YouTube. In the age of celebrity culture, some children seek to emulate their favourite stars by gaining thousands of online followers. And Miss Frostrup said the teenager was left traumatised and needing therapy after being targeted by a predator who used the promise of more followers on the video sharing website to lure him in. She said: ‘[He] found himself inundated with new friends on Facebook after posting a particularly “entertaining” video on a site recommended by his favourite YouTubers. These new friends assured him he had star potential and promised to quadruple his following if he met them on an unregulated site. ‘For kids who dream of the superstar status of YouTube sensations like the Jacksgap twins [sibling video bloggers who found fame with their channel about gap year travels], the quest for followers can be a dangerous obsession. Warning: Miss Frostrup, 52, said she was beginning to fear the 'predatory presence of paedophiles' online. 'He befriended one in particular, a supposedly abused girl who wanted his help and began sending him pictures of her abuse. Pandora’s box flew open and an avalanche of pornography involving men and kids poured forth which he found deeply disturbing but was too embarrassed to tell anyone about. ‘In a matter of weeks he’d been enticed into hell and his new “friend” was revealed as an adult man. Luckily, he eventually broke down and told his mother. Several visits to the police station and many hours of counselling have returned her traumatised son to the happy-go-lucky, confident creature he once was.’ Miss Frostrup made her comments in her Waitrose Weekend column, becoming the latest in a number of high profile names to voice concerns about the safety of children online. She said: ‘As we flock this festive season to purchase our kids their dream presents – tablets and smartphones, laptops and similar devices – I offer this as a salutary reminder that it’s not just in news stories that young people are being targeted and abused. We are buying our kids entry to an unknown universe and with “location access” switched on, a tracking device for strangers.’ Miss Frostrup she went</s>","Mariella Frostrup urged parents to be aware of risky tablets and phones.

"(CNN) -- An overwhelming vote by residents of the Falkland Islands to remain under British rule didn't quell claims from Argentina on Tuesday. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner called this week's two-day referendum a ""parody"" and maintained that the territory, which Argentina calls Las Malvinas, rightfully belongs to her country. ""It is as if a consortium of occupiers had voted on whether to continue illegally occupying a building,"" she said at an event in Buenos Aires. ""The results were fixed."" Asked whether they wanted to remain a British Overseas Territory, more than 99% of voters who cast ballots said yes, according to a Falkland Islands government spokesman. Just three people voted no, spokesman Darren Christie said. Pictures at the polls showed some residents of the islands draped in Union flags as they cast their votes. Cars displayed banners that read, ""We're British and proud."" A parade honoring British heritage marked the start of voting Sunday. The vote drew praise from British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""It's the clearest possible result there could be,"" he said, ""and the fact is that the Falkland Islands may be thousands of miles away, but they are British through and through, and that is how they want to stay."" Argentina should respect the will of the islanders, he said, adding that the United Kingdom ""will always be there to defend them."" Before the results were announced, one lawmaker from the islands criticized Argentina for arguing that the vote was illegitimate. ""I believe we are like other people in the world, and we are entitled to determine our own future.... I think it's dreadful that someone like Argentina should be trying to deny us that,"" Sharon Halford, a member of the Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly, told CNN. ""They obviously don't care what their own people think, but worldwide, everybody has the right to determine their own future, and why should we not be the same?"" Argentina's top diplomat in the United Kingdom, meanwhile, maintained her government's position that the referendum did nothing to settle the issue. ""The British inhabitants of the Malvinas Islands unquestionably enjoy civil and political rights,"" Argentinian Ambassador Alicia Castro said in a statement Tuesday. ""But they do not have the right to decide the sovereignty dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom."" Renewed tensions. The two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then-military government in Argentina landed troops on the islands. Argentina put its death toll from the conflict at around 645. Britain says its civil and military losses amounted to 255. For more than a year, renewed rhetoric between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the islands has escalated to a fever pitch, with both sides accusing each other of colonialism. What lies behind renewed tensions over Falkland Islands? Prince William's military deployment to the islands last year further fueled tensions, drawing sharp criticism from Argentinian officials. In January, Fernandez wrote an open letter, published in the British press, calling on Britain to hand back the islands and accusing it of blatant colonialism. She cited a 1965 U.N. resolution inviting the two countries to negotiate a solution to the sovereignty dispute and has called on the British to abide by the resolution. The British government accuses Argentina of trying to coerce island residents by intimidating those involved in fishing and oil exploration and trying to isolate the remote islands by limiting access by sea. British officials have rejected Fernandez's call for negotiations, saying the people of the Falkland Islands have chosen to be British and ""have a right to self-determination as enshrined in the U.N.</s>","NEW: Argentina's president calls the Falkland Islands referendum a ""parody"" Britain will always defend the people of the Falklands, Cameron said. Overwhelming percentage of voters said they want the Falklands to remain a territory.

"A mother who fell pregnant at 11 has spoken of the ordeal she faced after her daughter's birth. Tressa Middleton, now 20, has revealed the trauma she experienced as a warning to Britain's youngest mother who gave birth on Sunday. Miss Middleton, from Bathgate, West Lothian, was five months older than the schoolgirl when she fell pregnant in 2005 - as a result she spent several years addicted to drugs and alcohol after quitting school. Tressa Middleton with her mother and daughter in 2006. Tressa Middleton, now 20, wants to offer advice to Britain's youngest mother who gave birth on Sunday after falling pregnant aged just 11 years and six month. She was forced to give up her toddler for adoption two years after giving birth - the decision came after she revealed the baby was born as the result of a rape by her own brother. Today Miss Middleton said she wanted to get in touch with Britain’s youngest parents - the schoolgirl, who became pregnant by her 13-year-old ‘boyfriend’ when she was still in primary school at the age of 11 and gave birth to a 7lb 4oz girl at the weekend. Miss Middleton told The Sun: 'I send her my warmest congratulations but it will be incredibly tough. At that age you’re so worried about what other people think at school. 'I had people throwing things at me with the baby in the buggy. And the bullies taunting you in the playground - that’s the worst.' New record: A couple have become Britain's youngest parents after a girl aged 12 gave birth. Their faces have been pixellated to protect their identities. Miss Middleton discovered she was pregnant in 2005 and at first claimed a local boy was the father to protect her mother, Tracey Tallons, 39. After giving birth she describes that she never stopped the 'fags and drink', and soon spiralled out of control under the very noses of her social workers. She ended up in a residential unit, rather than with her child. 'It went downhill from there,' she told the Daily Mail in 2012. 'I was seeing her, but only for short periods. 'She went from calling me Mum and reaching out for me, to not wanting to come near me. She would be screaming. New record: A couple have become Britain's youngest parents after a girl aged 12 gave birth. Their faces have been pixellated to protect their identities. She tried to commit suicide when she saw authorities were going to take the child away in 2008, swallowing as many drugs as she could. She told friends she 'didn't want her baby to have a mother who was this f***** up anyway'. But her stomach was pumped, and her life saved. When she was 14, she finally revealed that her twisted brother Jason was in fact the father of her child. When it came out, her family fell apart in the event, and Miss Middleton was left to sign papers authorising the adoption. 'I signed the papers because I knew I would lose in court and they would take her from me anyway. This way I thought I would get visitation rights.' But she hasn't seen her daughter for six years - not since she handed her over to her adoptive parents, 'who seemed very nice'. She is only entitled to a letter twice a year, updating her on her child's progress. She says she has kept all her child's clothes, and sleeps with a little pink Babygro and hat under her pillow.

Buday says former Yankees owners Jacob Ruppert and Del Webb heard of Timur's work from his sister, who worked in Brooklyn as a manicurist in the 1930s. Timur, who lived in Europe at the time, created a logo that incorporated a top hat and bat similar to the one now used by the team.

"A high school student has died after a friend moved a hunting rifle in the back of his truck and the gun accidentally went off, shooting the teen dead. Jaden Rahm, 16, was driving three school friends to get lunch at one of their houses in Yuma, Colorado on Monday when the boy in the seat behind him moved the gun used for duck hunting. The rifle went off and the round went through the driver's seat, hitting Rahm in the torso, Sheriff Chad Day told the Denver Channel. Yuma Police received a call about the shooting at 11.58am just south of Yuma High School's campus. The sheriff's office announced his death that afternoon. Tragic: Jayden Rahm, 16, was accidentally shot dead when a friend moved a gun in his car as they headed for lunch on Monday. He was driving his parents' car and the gun was used for bird hunting. Star: The 16-year-old sophomore was remembered by friends as a great athlete and a gentleman. Authorities said the three other teenagers in the car at the time are not considered suspects. No one else was injured. Sheriff Day told the Denver Channel that it's common for people to leave their guns in their trucks during hunting season. Jaden had been driving his family's work truck at the time. 'There is still some forensic evidence that needs to be processed and an autopsy needs to be performed, but evidence points to this being a tragic accident,' the department said in a statement. It is unlikely any charges will be filed, they said. Rahm, a sophomore, played varsity baseball and hoped to be a farmer.

The mystery surrounding the disappearance of two friends that has baffled police deepened when their clothes were discovered on the rocks of a small island off the coast of Maine yesterday. Zachary Wells, 21, and Prescott Wright, 23, were last seen hanging out at a home in the seaside community on Thursday, police chief Craig Sanford said. The breakthrough in one of the strangest cases police have seen came when authorities discovered the clothing, including one item that was marked to indicate that it belonged to one of the men said Sanford. Missing: Zachary Wells, 21, (left) and Prescott Wright, 23, (right) vanished after a party on Wednesday night. The disappearance of the two friends baffled authorities, who have searched by air, water and in wooded areas for the men. Wells and Wright are students at The Landing School in Arundel, Maine., where they were learning boat building and yacht design. When the men failed to show up for classes on Thursday and Friday, administrators at the school contacted police. Authorities found no signs of a. disturbance at the home, Sanford said, and searches of the nearby area. did not turn up any clues. Only one of the men owns a vehicle, and it remained parked in the driveway of the house. 'There's no one area to pinpoint. because we don't know where they might have gone,' said Sanford, calling. it one of the strangest cases he has ever seen. Both men were expected to head to their home states for the holidays. Zachary. Wells, and Prescott Wright, were last seen drinking beer at Wells' home. in Kennebunkport, Maine around midnight on Wednesday. But when one of Wells' roommates went downstairs to turn off a radio at 4am, neither man was there. Last seen: Friends saw the two men at midnight on Wednesday at Wells' home, pictured, but when one of his roommates awoke at 4am and went downstairs to turn off a radio, they were gone. When they did not turn up for classes at The. Landing School - where they were learning boat building and yacht. design - in Arundel on Thursday and Friday, administrators called the. police. Nothing indicates foul play, Police Chief Craig Sanford said, and searches of ocean waters, roadsides and marshy areas have failed to turn up any clues on their whereabouts. 'There's no one area to pinpoint because we don't know where they might have gone,' he said, adding that the disappearance is one of the strangest cases he's seen. Authorities found no signs of a. disturbance at the home. One of the men owns a vehicle but it. remained parked in the driveway of the house. Witnesses said the men appeared drunk. Robert DeColfmacker, president of the Landing School, told the Portland Press Herald that Wells' roommates said the two men had left their cellphones and wallets at the home.

"By. Becky Barrow. It started out as a small drapers shop on London’s Oxford Street in 1864. But 150 years’ later, John Lewis has become Britain’s favourite retailer inspiring ‘exceptionally high loyalty’ among its army of devoted shoppers. Yesterday the retail analysts Verdict said John Lewis, which has annual sales of around £4billion a year, won first prize in its annual competition to find ‘the nation’s best retailer'. Retail analysts Verdict said John Lewis, which has annual sales of around £4billion a year, won first prize in its annual competition to find 'the nation's best retailer' The announcement was not entirely surprising. Verdict has held the competition for the last 15 years - and John Lewis has come top ten times. And when it does not come top, it comes second (except for one shaming occasion in 2012 when it came third). Sarah Peters, an analyst at Verdict, said: ‘As Britain’s favourite retailer, John Lewis continues to deliver the product ranges, inspiration and trust that customers appreciate.’ There are just 41 John Lewis department stores in the UK. When the most recent one opened in York two weeks ago, there were 150 people queuing outside at 8.30am, 30 minutes before it opened its doors. John Lewis, part of the John Lewis Partnership, which also includes Waitrose, is best-known for its ‘never knowingly undersold’ policy, which pledges to offer the best price on the high-street. John Lewis opened its first shop on Oxford Street, London in 1864, pictured. It sells everything from bed linen and mattresses to children’s clothes and cots to plates, saucepans and knives, and typically stocks around 350,000 different products in its department stores. Last year, iPads, chocolate coins, vacuum cleaner bags, cereal bowls, Egyptian cotton bedding, Lego mini figures and mascara were among its top ten best-selling products. The company’s performance is helped by its unusual structure, which means its partners - that is, its workforce - own the business. 1. John Lewis. 2. Dunelm. 3. IKEA. 4. Brantano. 5. Matalan. Each year, they are paid a bonus, which is a percentage of their basic salary. All partners receive the same percentage of their salary. This year, for example, John Lewis Partnership’s 91,000 partners, including 29,000 who work for John Lewis, shared £202.5million. Each got 15 per cent of their salary, equal to nearly eight weeks’ pay. Such is the appeal of the John Lewis Partnership brand that a recent report found homes are more valuable if they have a branch of Waitrose nearby. On average, the report, from the estate agency Savills, found the average home with a nearby Waitrose is 25.3 per cent more expensive than the average price in the whole of the county.

"Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone joked about the unrest in Bahrain that has left several dead and scores injured. The Gulf state yesterday defied anti-government demonstrators to go ahead and stage its Grand Prix. Mr Ecclestone laughed off the clashes, saying: ‘You know what they say, there’s no such thing as bad publicity.’ The race track – 25 miles from the capital Manama – was heavily guarded by police with dogs and armoured vehicles after intensifying violence in recent days. Scroll down for video. Shocking: A masked man raises a burning Molotov Cocktail before hurling it into a burning pile of tyres in Bahrain during a protest against Formula One being held in the country....But it's business as usual for Bernie: Despite the raging protests outside, inside the circuit, Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, left, was happy to joke around as the race got underway. Dead: Protestor, Salah Abbas Habib, 37, was found dead, north of the Bahraini capital on Saturday - his family claim he was beaten to death by police during a demonstration. But the event took place without. incident. Afterwards, Mr Ecclestone added: ‘We will be back here next. year, and for many years after, because they do a first class job.’ Outside the Bahrain Grand Prix groups of masked protestors chanting anti-government slogans set piles of tyres ablaze and hurled Molotov cocktails into the air. But it was business as usual inside the circuit at Sakhir as Sebastian Vettel held off Kimi Raikkonen to win the race. It. went ahead without any reported hiccups despite two days of mass. protests that saw demonstrators demand the 'gaudy spectacle' so loved by the ruling family that crushed Arab Spring demonstrations last year, be cancelled. The 'three days of rage' began on Friday when up to 7,000 people clashed with. police and troops armed with tear gas and stun grenades who were. guarding roads around the ‘locked down’ capital Manama. Tensions ahead of yesterday's race intensified after a protestor,. 37-year-old Salah Abbas Habib, was found dead, north of the Bahraini. capital. Mr Habib's family claim he was beaten to death by. police. Formula One has been a symbol of pride for the. ruling royal family since Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad. al-Khalifa brought the first Grand Prix to the region in. 2004. The luxury sporting event is the. government's chance to prove that life has gone back to normal in the. island kingdom after security concerns over anti-government. demonstrations forced last year's race to be cancelled. Women in garish outfits wearing. feathered headdresses and dripping in jewels were paraded in front of. the press, while Mr Ecclestone posed with a woman dressed as a clown and shared a joke with Bahraini Crown Prince Sheik Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa. Mr Ecclestone had insisted all weekend that he had no intention of axing the race despite fears for the drivers' safety in the troubled Gulf state. He even called for 'an earthquake or something like that' to detract attention away from the event. He said: 'I can’t call this race off. Nothing to do with us. We have an agreement to be here and we’re here.

"(CNN) -- No matter the years she has been away and the miles that separate her, Crystal Roles still calls Naoma, West Virginia, home. She left the mining town with her high school sweetheart, soon after they graduated and married in 1989. But every trip back home -- to the area the world has been watching for days -- is a reunion with a special world for the coal miner's daughter. ""It's a breed of people, a group of people that are like nobody else,"" says Roles, 39. ""The same people who are underground now, looking for the four missing, are kids I went to high school with."" Authorities confirmed early Saturday that rescue efforts had came to a grim end after crews found the bodies of four miners who had been missing since the explosion almost a week ago. The death toll from Monday's blast at the Upper Big Branch mine now stands at 29, making it the worst mining disaster in the United States in nearly four decades. Rescue crews going underground, Roles says, may have had ""to step over one of their neighbors, a deacon in their church or someone who recently sat on the front porch with them having a glass of tea."" Since the explosion, outsiders have tuned in to the news from her hometown. But for those who live there or were raised in mining communities, the story will continue long after the media trucks pull away. Grounded in family ties, hard work and pride, it is a story that links generations and binds people together. It is a life driven by harsh economic realities -- the need to have work and support families. It comes with a steep price: Miners hold one of the most dangerous jobs in America. In West Virginia, the average miner brings home $68,000 a year, according to 2007 figures provided by the National Mining Association -- a salary the organization says is 100 percent higher than the average state wage. Because of her deep connection to Naoma, Roles, who now lives in Hickory, North Carolina, has hung on every shred of information she can get. Text messages from cousins came almost immediately Monday evening. And through phone calls to her parents, she knows her 63-year-old father, Benny Crum, is a wreck. See Roles' iReport posting. ""I've cried ever since this happened. My heart is broke,"" Crum, a former miner, said Thursday night. ""Coal miners -- it's like a fraternity. When it comes to one of them getting hurt, we all hurt. You want to go and help."" Forced into retirement 18 years ago, after he said black lung disease made the work impossible, Crum feels there's little he can do. Dependent on oxygen tanks, he listened to his scanner Monday night and watched and worried as others raced to the Upper Big Branch coal mine. Later, from his porch, he looked on as his community formed a candlelight vigil. Being a coal miner was in his blood and all Crum ever wanted to do. The danger of his job, roof bolting -- or supporting the ceilings to keep others safe -- was like a drug that fueled him during 18-hour days. His father began working in the mines at age 12, the day after his own father died on the job. ""My daddy was a miner for 57 years. Most of his life was spent underground,"" Crum said. Among the miners are men who defy the stereotypes held by some outsiders, Crum said. Though they are miners, they are also teachers, ministers, police officers. They're people who are trained and do this work because they are proud to, or because their other career choices haven't paid enough to support their families. Crum said he's seen coal miners quit</s>","Mine disaster shines spotlight on community steeped in pride, hard work and danger. Former miner a wreck: ""When it comes to one of them getting hurt, we all hurt"" Miners include teachers, ministers and police officers, defying stereotypes, miner says.

Facebook is tipped to spend up to $60million on buying Texas-based Titan Aerospace, which makes drones that can fly solo for five years without needing to land, in order to bring affordable internet access to some five billion people who don’t have it. In April, Google also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones (pictured) to provide similar connectivity. Power: Titan Aerospace's drone is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kW of electricity - it flies above the clouds, so it is exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours. Wingspan and payload: 60 metres wide. The Solara 60 carries a payload of 250 pounds. Speed: Cruising speed for the Solara is about 65 mph. Function: The drone can be used for surveillance, crop-monitoring, weather and disaster oversight - or to provide communication, which is what Facebook is said to be interested in. Distance: The unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles. TechCrunch has reported that the social network, which is a backer of the Internet.org initiative, is interested in using some 11,000 high altitude drones to bring internet access to rural Africa and other parts of the world that are not connected. The company is said to be interested in using the Solara 60 model, which is light-weight solar-powered and can fly at 65,000 feet for five years non-stop. The Solara unmanned aircraft is 60 metres wide and self-sufficient as it is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kW of electricity. Facebook is a backer of the Internet.org initiative and is rumoured to be interested in using 11,000 high altitude drones to bring internet access to remote regions of Africa and other parts of the world that are not online. Kenya's first call centre, which opened in 2005, is pictured, but plenty of parts of the continent do not have internet access. As it flies above the clouds, it is exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours and store energy for the night flight. The drones are described as ‘atmospheric satellites’ that could be used for surveillance, to monitor weather and communications. Facebook is interested in the latter function and reportedly thinks the drones could be used to provide sustainable regional internet systems. A source told TechCrunch that if Titan Aerospace was acquired, all its drones would be used for the Internet.org project, which is competing with Google’s ‘Project Loon’. Google’s effort plans on using balloons instead of drones to bring internet access to rural and remote areas of the world.

"By. Julian Robinson for MailOnline. Parents disillusioned with the school system have sold their house and pulled their children out of classes - to take them on a year-long educational road trip of the UK in a caravan. Amy and Ella Meek, aged 11 and nine, will attend 'road school' supervised by their mother and father who are both teachers from Arnold, Nottingham. The girls will swap classrooms and formal tests for trips to castles, museums and libraries up and down the country. Scroll down for video. Tim, and Kerry Meek, pictured, have taken their children Amy (right), 11, and Ella (left), nine, out of school for a year-long educational road trip. The trip, which will take at least a year, will take in the likes of Stonehenge, the Scilly Isles and salmon rivers in Scotland. The trip, which will take at least a year, will take in Stonehenge, the Scilly Isles and salmon rivers in Scotland. Father Tim and mother Kerry quit their jobs and sold their house to fund the trip, which will cover up to 20,000 miles. Most schoolchildren are now back at school facing a controversial new National Curriculum which requires five-year-olds to learn fractions and pupils in early secondary school to study Shakespeare. But the Meek family are in Peterborough where lessons include a science project looking at the mechanics of a trebuchet - a type of catapult used in the Middle Ages. Mr Meek, who quit his role at Derrymount Special School, Arnold, Nottingham, said: 'Children are not sausages in a sausage factory to be pumped full of facts and content ready for regurgitation at the end of some arbitrary Key Stage, when they take high-stakes assessments. 'We've given ourselves a minimum of an academic year but we are realistic and we know the girls will return to school at some point. Mr and Mrs Meek, pictured with their daughters, quit their jobs and sold their house to fund the trip, which will cover up to 20,000 miles. For the girls' first day of 'road school' on Monday, they visited historic Warwick Castle in Warwickshire (pictured) 'It's one of those things that's scary and people say you are brave, or silly. One thing we do know is that it's going to be a year to remember.' The 45-year-old stressed that he and wife Kerry, 39, were not unhappy with staff at the school, or at Richard Bonington Primary and Nursery in Arnold, Nottingham, where the girls attended. 'Education is becoming overly dominated with tests, assessments and targets, at the expense of rich, engaging and enjoyable learning,' said Mr Meek, who has budgeted to spend £20,000 on the trip.

Samuel Eto'o has revealed he would like to personally apologise to Jordan Henderson for a horror tackle on the midfielder during Chelsea's Premier League win over Liverpool, but has hit back at critics claiming the forward should have been penalised for a foul on Luis Suarez. The Chelsea striker was heavily involved in the Premier League clash and scored Chelsea's winning goal which incensed Liverpool players as they felt the Cameroonian should have been sent off for raking a boot down Henderson's shin in the fourth minute.

A 94-yard village street with just 16 semi-detached homes has residents fuming after they counted 80 potholes. They will have to endure the bumps through winter as there is no money left to repair Rothbury Avenue, South Tyneside - and there is no guarantee it will be done next year either. Driven potty: Winter has only just begun but residents of bumpy Rothbury Avenue in Monkton Village, South Tyneside, have counted 80 potholes. There is no money left to fix them until at least next spring. Appalling: How one resident described the road, claiming it was the worst in Britain - is yours even worse? Funding gap: Labour South Tyneside Council says it will not prioritise the street because it is a minor road. Frederick Lazenby, 80, has launched a petition calling on South Tyneside Council to fix Rothbury Avenue, in Monkton Village. He said: 'It's in a terrible state. It has been like this since I moved in 30 years ago. It has just got worse and worse. 'There. are a lot of old people in the street and those in wheelchairs are. having difficulty getting across the road. Those driving cars are. finding the road terrible as well. 'They are trying to dodge them but you can't anymore - there are that many of them. 'It is definitely worse than any other street in Britain that I know of.' Resident Frederick Lazenby, 80, said: 'Those in wheelchairs are having difficulty getting across the road' Residents of the street's 16 houses have threatened to sue the council if their cars are damaged by the bumps. A Nightmare on Rothbury Avenue: The street in Monkton Village, South Tyneside, is just 94 yards long. South Tyneside Council says repairing the road will cost £5,157, a price it cannot afford - because its road repairs budget has already dried up. Executive director Mike Conlon said: 'The council's current mainstream road resurfacing budget is fully committed for the current year. Councils across England and Wales have united to claim potholes will hit 'crisis point' this winter. They begged the government for more cash, saying years of spending cuts meant projects already 'on the back burner' were being delayed further and further. Transport chairman for the Local Government Association, Cllr Peter Box, blamed 'decades of underfunding by Whitehall'. He said in March: 'We're now facing a bill of £10.5 billion to bring our roads up to scratch. Unless something changes we risk swathes of Britain's road network becoming dangerously strewn with potholes, particularly if flooding and severe winters become more common.' Potholes appear over winter when water repeatedly freezes and thaws inside cracks in the road surface, opening them wider. Most councils use instant 'emergency repairs' to fix danger potholes, but these have to be followed up with a permanent, more expensive fix which many authorities say they are struggling to afford.

"(CNN) -- Ten-man Chelsea produced an astonishing comeback to recover from 2-0 down on the night and beat defending champions Barcelona 3-2 on aggregate in a scarcely believable Champions League semifinal at the Camp Nou on Tuesday. Chelsea began the second-leg tie with a slender 1-0 lead and looked doomed when captain John Terry was sent off for violent conduct in the 37th minute and Andres Iniesta put Barcelona 2-1 up overall shortly afterward. But Ramires put Chelsea ahead on away goals moments before halftime and Chelsea somehow held off wave after wave of Barcelona attack after the break before snatching a 2-2 draw. Lionel Messi hit the bar with a penalty early in the second half and later had another shot pushed onto the post by Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech. Substitute Fernando Torres completed the most unlikely of wins when he scored on the break in injury time to guarantee Chelsea's place in the final of Europe's top club competition for the second time in the English side's history. Is Chelsea win sport's greatest upset? ""It is an incredible achievement by this group of players,"" said Chelsea coach Robeto di Matteo, who took over in early March on an interim basis when Andre Villas Boas was sacked. ""A lot of people have written us off but we showed the character these players have."" Chelsea will play either Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in the May 19 final at the latter's Allianz Arena. They will have to do without Terry, Branislav Ivanovic, Ramires and Raul Meireles, who will all be suspended, but that was at the back of the players' minds as they celebrated one of the club's greatest wins. ""It was not beautiful,"" Torres said, ""and we were playing the best team in the world, but Barcelona did not take their chances and, in the end, it worked for us."" Barcelona, meanwhile, now only have the Spanish Cup to play for after losing to Real Madrid at the weekend and all but conceding the La Liga title. ""It wasn't meant to be this year,"" coach Josep Guardiola said. ""The first thing that goes through my head is immense sorrow. ""We played exceptionally well for 180 minutes, we did everything we could to be in the final. We've never worked this hard to be in a final. We failed because we didn't score (more goals)."" Having come away from the first leg ahead due to Didier Drogba's goal, Chelsea traveled to the Camp Nou knowing Barcelona had won their last 15 home matches in the Champions League. Things started badly when defender Gary Cahill limped off after 12 minutes and got worse when midfielder Sergio Busquets put Barcelona ahead in the 35th minute from Isaac Cuenca's cutback. Two minutes later, former England captain Terry inexplicably raised his knee as he ran up behind Alexis Sanchez and was shown a straight red card -- leaving Chelsea without both their center halves. ""I want to apologize to the lads and the fans,"" Terry said later. ""I feel like I've let the lads down."" A minute after Terry departed, Iniesta looked to have set Barcelona on their way to the final when he finished off a trademark passing move with a precise, low shot into the far corner from Messi's through ball. Terry's absence meant midfielder Ramires was pushed into action as a right back but it was the Brazilian who unexpectedly gave Chelsea hope before halftime. Barcelona had their own defensive reorganization to carry out when Gerard Pique came off after 25 minutes with a head injury to be replaced by Dani Alves, and the hosts were wide open at the back as Ramires skipped on to Frank Lampard's pass and</s>","Chelsea sub Fernando Torres seals 3-2 aggregate win over Barcelona.

"(CNN) -- The death toll from a cholera outbreak in Haiti has risen to more than 150 confirmed deaths, according to health officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Agency for International Development. At a joint news conference held Friday, Dr. Rob Quick and Dr. Carleene Dei discussed the outbreak and efforts to work out a containment strategy. The CDC will send an 11-member team to Haiti over the next few days to find out which antibiotics will be most effective in treating the cholera outbreak. US AID will provide supplies needed to set up treatment centers. The group has already prepositioned 300,000 oral re-hydration kits and are distributing water purification kits in affected areas. Officials also confirmed that all the reported cases are in the Artibonite and Central Plateau regions, north of Port-au-Prince. They said they're working to contain the outbreak there and prevent its spread to the densely populated capital. Chaos reigned acrooss the Artibonite and Central Plateau regions Friday, as hospitals overflowed with people rushing to get help from the fast-moving cholera outbreak. Eric Lotz, Haiti's national director for the nonprofit Operation Blessing, described a ""horrific"" scene outside St. Nicolas hospital, the main medical facility in the city of St. Marc, as patients and their family members fought to get care. ""There was bedlam outside the gate,"" said Lotz. ""Inside (the hospital), every square inch is covered with people."" Some people waited 24 hours or more to get help outside the hospital, many of them on stretchers, said Terry Snow, Haiti director for the nonprofit Youth With a Mission. Snow said he tried to take one man with cholera to various clinics, only to end up at St. Nicolas hospital and be told that it was full. The man died soon thereafter in the back of his truck, he said. ""It's very chaotic,"" Snow said of the scene in St. Marc and more rural agricultural areas nearby. ""People are trying to figure out what to do. People are lost."" Sandrellie Seraphin, who works for Partners in Health and the Clinton Foundation, visited the hospital Wednesday. ""It's terrible,"" she told CNN by phone, describing the crowds of people trying to get help. ""There's a great fear among the people"" about the disease. 1,526 people have been sickened in the outbreak, said Imogen Wall, the U.N. humanitarian spokeswoman in Haiti. This comes after recent heavy rains caused the banks of the Artibonite River to overflow and flood the area. Dammed in 1956 to create Lac de Peligre, the Artibonite River is Haiti's dominant drainage system, according to the U.S. Library of Congress. Snow said that ""constant miscommunication and confusion"" have hindered aid efforts, though he expressed hope things may improve Friday as more help comes in. On Friday, Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive called the cholera outbreak ""unprecedented"" and said authorities were working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to understand what happened. ""We have to determine... where (the cholera) came from,"" he said. Cholera is caused by a bacterial infection of the intestine and, in severe cases, is characterized by diarrhea, vomiting and leg cramps, according to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In such cases, rapid loss of body fluids can lead to dehydration and shock. ""Without treatment, death can occur within hours,"" the agency says. A person can get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the bacteria. During epidemics, the source of</s>","NEW: Death toll has risen to more than 150 in cholera outbreak.

"A United Airlines flight from London Heathrow to Washington, DC, was forced to make an emergency landing on Thursday evening after the captain reported smoke in the cockpit. The flight crew declared an emergency while the Boeing 777-222 was flying over the Irish Sea and diverted the plane to Dublin Airport less than an hour into its transatlantic journey. With smoke in the cockpit and forward cabin, members of the flight crew were forced to wear their oxygen masks, although the cabin crew found no visible evidence of a fire on board. Emergency: A United Airlines flight from London landed in Dublin after smoke was detected in the cockpit. Several people at the airport tweeted photos of the plane after it landed safely on its second attempt. This map shows the aircraft's flight path over Ireland while it prepared to land in Dublin. Flight UA925 was cruising at 36,000ft and had just crossed the Welsh when the crew alerted air traffic controllers around 5.45 pm, the Irish Independent reported. The plane – carrying 139 passengers and crew – dumped fuel over Ireland so that it would be lighter when it landed. On its final approach to Dublin Airport the aircraft aborted its first landing attempt due to poor weather conditions and circled around to try again. When the plane landed safely on its second attempt around 6.15pm it was met by firefighters and paramedics, who were placed on standby as a precaution. Passenger Jessica Kerr sent a series of tweets after the flight was diverted to Dublin. Flight UA925 was met by firefighters and paramedics when it landed at Dublin Airport. The flight crew declared an emergency while the plane was flying over the Irish Sea. Dublin Fire Brigade sent tweets saying it was responding with three pumps and an ambulance for the aircraft emergency. Ireland's National Ambulance Service sent three ambulances as a precaution. The fire brigade later tweeted that the plane had landed safely and cleared the runway, and that an investigation was underway. Dublin Fire Brigade responded with three pumps and an ambulance for the aircraft emergency. The plane aborted its first landing attempt due to poor weather but landed safely on its second attempt.

"The most talented young player Sir Alex Ferguson has seen on a training pitch is on the market and available. Aged 21. On a free transfer. It was three years ago when Manchester United became tired of his antics and sent him packing. Now West Ham too have reached the conclusion Ravel Ryan Morrison is damaged goods. Banned from West Ham’s first-team training ground as they continue to flirt with the top six, Sam Allardyce has demanded that he ‘changes his whole life’ and — in the meantime — trains with the reserves elsewhere in Essex, away from their Chadwell Heath base. West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison is not wanted by the club and is available on a free transfer. Morrison's only Premier League appearance for West Ham this season was against Southampton in August. Midfielder Morrison appears to smoke a cigar (left) and chats on the phone in August, 2014 (right) The talented midfielder takes a shot against Brighton and Hove Albion during a loan spell at QPR last season. Teams played for: West Ham, Cardiff (loan), QPR (loan), Birmingham (loan), Manchester United. Appearances: 81. Goals: 14. Honours: FA Youth Cup (2011) Such is his declining reputation, Morrison — ambitiously considered by some to be a contender for the World Cup with England last summer — has let it be known that, if anyone will take him, he will sign a new contract with all the risk on his side. Morrison is seeking a relatively modest £15,000 a week (the same wage he is paid by West Ham). And there is a further incentive for his next club: he is prepared to waive any right to compensation should a club terminate his employment for stepping out of line. Even then, one Premier League chairman approached by Morrison’s advisers this week described it as ‘too risky’, and could not be convinced otherwise even when it was pointed out the risk was all Morrison’s. In England, according to one source close to Morrison, clubs are ‘paralysed by fear’ when presented with the prospect of hiring him. They can see he has ability, outrageous ability. And they remember the goals. But they also fear, in the high-stakes world of Premier League football, that introducing Morrison to a dressing room could prove incredibly divisive. One imagines they are influenced by the stories they hear; some well documented, some less so. But as events at Manchester Crown Court have demonstrated this week, not all of them are true. Morrison poses with three friends in a picture posted to his official Instagram account in February 2014. Morrison was controversially pictured wearing an Arsenal home shirt before the start of the current season. The 21-year-old made seven Championship appearances and failed to score during a loan spell with Cardiff. Talking this week to people who have encountered Morrison, to people who know him extremely well too, the lack of consistency in their accounts of the 21-year-old is every bit as startling as the stories themselves. One reason given for why West Ham lost patience with Morrison was the suspicion that he had been driving without a licence. It is true Morrison is yet to pass his test but his representatives insist that he, like any learner driver, always has a qualified driver of the correct age siting alongside him. When the allegation was put to one source who was keen to defend Morrison, he rather worryingly replied: ‘He hasn’t done that (driven) for weeks and weeks.’ Concern about whether Morrison will turn up fuels the doubt in the boardroom, even among the Premier League’s most desperate clubs such as QPR, Hull and Aston Villa. It is claimed he went AWOL</s>",West Ham boss Sam Allardyce wants Ravel Morrison to find a new club. The talented midfielder will be allowed to leave Upton Park for nothing. Morrison was let go by Sir Alex Ferguson after trouble off the pitch. The 21-year-old is struggling to convince another club to take him on. Morrison is willing to waive compensation if his contract is terminated.</s> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad>,<pad> By. Daily Mail Reporter.

"By. Daily Mail Reporter. 'Wordsworth would be having fits': Andrew Motion. William Wordsworth would be ‘having fits’ about the development planned for the countryside, former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion has said. Now president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, he made the claim as he criticised the Government’s ‘philistine’ relaxation of planning laws in favour of builders. He said: ‘It is pretty clear that Wordsworth would be having a series of fits about what is going on now and the great tragedy of it is that a lot of this stuff doesn’t need to happen. ‘There are a million-and-a-half brownfield sites available – build on them. The Government should be incentivising builders to build on them which provides the kind of housing that we need. ‘It regenerates often rather decayed landscapes, it means we don’t have to create new infrastructure. It is plain good sense. ‘We need to be extraordinarily vigilant about this because when it is gone, it is gone forever.’ Wordsworth immortalised the Lake District with his 1807 poem Daffodils.

"Senior leaders at the BBC are still passing the buck. Or in this case, one might say the yuan. BBC Trust Chairman Lord Patten told a group of investigators that he blamed the ‘horrible screw-up’ surrounding the Jimmy Savile sex scandal on the ‘Chinese management style’ of the organization’s former director general Mark Thompson and the ineptitude of his successor George Entwistle, it was revealed Friday. Lord Patten, the Trust’s chairman since May 2011, said the BBC had ‘more senior leaders than China’ under Thompson with 25 to 27 people on his senior management team. 'Chinese-style management': Lord Patten, pictured, said the BBC had'more senior leaders than China' under New York Time's chief executive Mark Thompson. ‘They never met,’ Lord Patten said, according to recently published transcripts and appendices to The Pollard Report, which was released to the public in December. Lord Patten told the Pollard investigators that the mishandling of the scandal continued after Thompson left due to the mismanaged team working under Entwistle. ‘I don't think the BBC needs more senior people in order to avoid making basic mistakes,’ Lord Patten said. He said Entwistle's lack of knowledge of the Savile sex abuse investigation was ironic given how frequently Entwistle referred to the ‘silo’ culture that had taken form under Thompson during interviews for the top position. Thompson, who became BBC's director general in June 2004, resigned in September and took over as chief executive of the New York Times in November. After his departure he told Andrew Marr, another former BBC employee, that the public broadcasting corporation was ‘getting very, very close to the edge’ after the latest round of cost-cutting. Entwistle resigned from the director general role in November 2012, less than two months after succeeding Thompson. Rapid turnover: Mark Thompson, left, resigned from from the director general role in September. George Entwistle, right, resigned from the director general role in November, less than two months after succeeding Thompson. Lord Patten told the Pollard investigators that the BBC’s acting director general Tim Davie, who took over when Entwistle resigned, has ‘two or three experienced people around him’ and that there is no longer an ‘impression of frantic faffing about’ when he walks into his office. Lord Patten also denied having prior knowledge of a plan to make Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, who decided not to broadcast an investigation into Savile sex abuse allegations in December 2011, ‘the fall guy’ for the crisis that ensued after the scandal made headlines in October. Savile, the former BBC television host who died last year at 84, is believed to have been one of Britain’s most prolific sex offenders after hundreds of allegations of child sex abuse and rape became public following his death. Lord Patten told the investigators some people at the BBC thought Rippon would make ‘a convenient fall guy’ and could be ‘hung out to dry’ but that the BBC Trust ‘never got to that position.’ The BBC Trust chairman said he was misled by senior executives during the organization’s mishandling of the scandal. Prior to joining the BBC, Lord Patten was the last governor of British Hong Kong before its handover to the People's Republic of China in July 1997. Alleged sex offender: Jimmy Savile, who died last year at 84, is believed to have been one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders after hundreds of allegations of child sex abuse and rape became public after his death.</s> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad>",BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten said the organization had'more senior leaders than China' under former director general Mark Thompson.

"Theirs was one of the most enduring political partnerships of all time. But that didn’t stop Margaret Thatcher from giving Ronald Reagan a good handbagging when he crossed her. Newly released National Archives files show the extent to which their relationship was put under strain following a coup in Grenada. Mrs Thatcher made clear her distaste for US military intervention in the Commonwealth territory, recognising it as a slight on the Queen’s authority as head of state. Despite their enduring political partnership, Margaret Thatcher was still prepared to give Ronald Reagan a good handbagging over the US intervention in Commonwealth territory. For his part, Mr Reagan saw himself as defending the island against the rebels, who he saw as an ‘unpleasant band of Left-wing thugs’. In a letter dated October 24, 1983, Mrs Thatcher wrote that his decision to take action caused her the ‘gravest concern’ and accused him of putting the lives of citizens at risk instead of protecting them. She says: ‘This action will be seen as intervention by a Western democratic country in the internal affairs of a small independent nation, however unattractive its regime.... ‘I must ask you to think most carefully about these points. I cannot conceal that I am deeply disturbed by your latest communication. ‘You asked for my advice. I have set it out and hope that even at this late stage you will take it into account before events are irrevocable.’ But he told her the US military were already ‘at zero’. Mrs Thatcher made clear her distaste for US military intervention in the Commonwealth territory of Grenada (left), recognising it as a slight on the Queen’s authority as head of state. In an account of a phone call on October 26, Reagan tells Mrs Thatcher that if he was in London, he would throw his hat in the door first – presumably to avoid being shot. Mrs Thatcher clearly wasn’t impressed as she barely spoke during their 15-minute conversation. He told her he ‘very much regretted’ the embarrassment caused and confessed he had been on a golf holiday when he was woken at 3am and informed of the situation.

"By. Snejana Farberov. Disgraced mom: Nicole McMillen, 44, seen in a 2012 booking photo, was sentenced Friday to three years and four months in prison for molesting her son's two teenage friends. A married middle-aged school employee from California was sentenced Friday to more than three years in a state prison for sexually molesting her teenage son's friends. Nicole McMillen, a 44-year-old mother of three from Irvine, was also ordered to register as a lifetime sex offender.

"By. Keith Gladdis. UPDATED:. 19:50 EST, 12 December 2011. Dramatic footage of a polar bear tending her newborn cubs in the flagship BBC show Frozen Planet was filmed in a Dutch zoo using fake snow. In one of the most engaging moments of its Winter episode, the tiny bears are shown mewling at their mother and nuzzling her for milk. Eight million viewers were led to believe the scene had been captured by BBC cameramen inside an underground cave in the brutal sub-zero temperatures of the Arctic wilderness. SCROLL DOWN TO SEE VIDEO. On thin ice: Sir David Attenborough with an anaesthetised polar bear in Svalbard during episode seven of the hit show Frozen Planet. Preparing for the new arrivals: The fake nest being built in a Dutch zoo, ahead of the birth of the polar bear cubs. Not as it seems: The 'den' in the wildlife park was constructed out of plaster and wood, built below the zoo's polar bear enclosure. It was fitted with cameras shortly before the birth. But the footage, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, and interspersed with real shots of the Arctic, was in fact filmed in a den made of plaster and wood in a wildlife enclosure. The truth behind the fakery is only revealed in a hard-to-find video among 14 other clips accompanying the Winter episode of the series on the BBC website. John Whittingdale MP, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sports committee, said it was ‘hugely disappointing’ viewers were misled. BBC editorial guidelines on wildlife programmes say that when it is impractical or unsafe to film something in the wild ‘it can be editorially and ethically justified to use captive animals’. The guidelines add: ‘But we must never claim that such sequences were shot in the actual location depicted in the film.’ Mr Whittingdale said: ‘Broadcasters should not seek to give viewers a false impression. If this was not filmed in the wild it would have been much better to have made that clear in the commentary. Moving scene: The pair of two-day-old polar bear cubs shown on the documentary. At this age they weighed less than a kilo, but were filmed in a zoo. The polar bear and cub inside the man-made den fashioned out of wood and covered in fake snow. Faked? What the viewers saw on Frozen Planet turned out not to be filmed in the wild, but in a Netherlands zoo. Mixed: The scene was mixed with real footage of polar bears in the wild, which may have misled viewers.

"Cristiano Ronaldo will demand a ground-breaking £500,000-a-week to join either Chelsea or Manchester United next summer. Real Madrid star Ronaldo last week confirmed a story Football Grapevine broke 18 months ago that he was on the verge of re-joining United in the summer of 2013. That deal was scuppered by the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson and the fact that United were not prepared to pay Ronaldo what he wanted and eventually got on a new deal with Real Madrid which is in the region of £350,000-a-week. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here. Cristiano Ronaldo will demand £500,000-a-week to join either Chelsea or Manchester United next summer. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a penalty in Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat against Atletico Madrid on Saturday. Since then, United have given Wayne Rooney a £300,000-a-week contract and last week signed Ramadal Falcao on a deal which will earn the Colombian £280,000-a-week. Falcao’s deal was sealed by super-agent Jorge Mendes, who is also Ronaldo’s agent. That United's American owners the Glazers have been prepared to loosen the purse strings to such an extent has encouraged Ronaldo to consider a return back to the Barclays Premier League. Indeed, Ronaldo last week hinted that he could leave Real Madrid next summer. And he would be ready to move back to Old Trafford which was on the brink of happening in summer 2013 but the deal collapsed over the players wage demands. The new policy at United has now changed the financial dynamic. But, given the links Mendes has with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and owner Roman Abramovich, Ronaldo could also be tempted to a move to the west London club. Radamel Falcao is being paid £390,000-a-week by Manchester United after a move from Monaco. Wayne Rooney (right, talking to Ryan Giggs) earns £300,000-a-week for playing at Old Trafford. Jose Mourinho's close links with Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes could see the player sign for Chelsea. I am hearing. Slaven Bilic, still boss of Turkish club Besiktas, has re-emerged as a potential successor to Sam Allardyce at West Ham even though he turned down David Sullivan before former manager Avram Grant (remember him) was given the job after Gianfranco Zola was sacked. I am also hearing. West Ham are set to offer 18-year-old starlet Reece Burke, who is nowhere near the first team, a £4,000-a-week contract to fend off interest from Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal. Slaven Bilic, boss of Besiktas, has re-emerged as a potential successor to Sam Allardyce at West Ham. Back Heel. Its been a tough start for Louis van Gaal at Manchester United but nothing can really compare to Brian Clough’s brief turbulent reign at Leeds. Its 40 years ago this week that Clough was sacked by Leeds after just six games, seven weeks, or more famously 44 days. A combination of his maverick managerial style and a set of Leeds players who resented the fact that father-figure Don Revie, who had been appointed England manager, had been replaced by Clough and by not veteran start Johnny Giles. To compound the situation Clough, who died ten years ago this week, did not disguise his loathing for the Leeds approach to the game or indeed Revie himself. Amazingly on the evening of his dismissal a Yorkshire TV chat shot managed to get both Clough and Revie in the studio.</s>","Cristiano Ronaldo could leave Real Madrid at the end of the season.

"Washington (CNN) -- Voters have given Republicans a mandate to cut government and roll back the Obama administration's health care ""monstrosity"" in the next Congress, the incoming speaker of the House of Representatives said Wednesday. Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, is poised to lead the House following the GOP's massive gains in Tuesday's midterm elections. He told reporters that he and President Barack Obama have agreed to work together but called the results a vote for ""a smaller, less costly, more accountable government."" And the administration's hard-won overhaul of the U.S. health care system ultimately will be on the block. ""The American people are concerned about the government takeover of health care,"" Boehner said. ""I think it's important for us to lay the groundwork before we begin to repeal this monstrosity and replace it with common-sense reforms that will bring down the cost of health insurance in America."" For his part, Obama blamed the anemic economy for the ""shellacking"" his fellow Democrats experienced, but he acknowledged that his policies hadn't done enough to bring down high unemployment. His administration has ""stabilized"" the economy and spurred private-sector hiring, ""but people all across America aren't feeling that progress,"" Obama said. ""I've got to take direct responsibility for the fact that we have not made as much progress as we need to make,"" Obama said. The president faced reporters a day after voters replaced at least 60 Democrats in the House of Representatives, handing control of the chamber to the Republicans for the first time since 2006, according to CNN projections. In the Senate, Democrats lost at least six seats but retained control of the chamber, according to the projections based on analysis of exit polling. In the latest result, Democratic incumbent Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado defeated Tea Party-backed Republican Ken Buck, CNN projected on Wednesday. Asked about claims by Republicans, especially Tea Party conservatives, that his policies are taking the country in the wrong direction, Obama cited the economy's reversal from monthly job losses to private sector job growth since he took office as proof that things were improving. But he also conceded, in reference to an auto-related campaign analogy, that the argument could be made that ""we're stuck in neutral."" Obama said he's looking at ""all ideas that are on the table"" to boost economic growth after the deepest recession since the 1930s and won't dismiss any proposal ""because they're Democrat or Republican."" At the same time, Obama said, it would be a ""misreading"" of the election results if anyone believed that the American people want to spend the next two years trying to ""relitigate"" his administration's overhaul of health care or other major legislation of his first two years in office. Republicans throughout the campaign blasted Obama's signature health care overhaul, the Affordable Care Act, after voting all but unanimously against it in Congress. Obama called the process of passing the bill ""an ugly mess"" and ""something that I regret"" but added: ""The outcome was a good one."" The health care law, parts of which are just taking effect, requires Americans to buy health insurance, provides subsidies to bring down the cost of those policies and bars insurers from denying coverage based on gender or pre-existing conditions. Despite the stated goal of Boehner and other Republicans to repeal the health care bill, the Democratic majority in the Senate makes it unlikely that will happen. More likely is legislative gridlock on health care and other issues, with the GOP-led House pushing for spending cuts, deregulation and other measures that will die in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

"By. James Chapman. Gaming machine operators face a clampdown in an attempt to protect problem gamblers. Their betting shop terminals are called the ‘crack cocaine’ of the high street because they allow punters to wager £100 a spin and as much as £18,000 an hour. Don Foster, the Lib Dem communities minister, has campaigned for this to be cut to £2 a spin – in line with bingo halls and casinos. Betting terminals have been branded the 'crack cocaine' of the high street due to the huge amounts they allow punters to bet. David Cameron and Nick Clegg have now agreed to examine a reversal of Labour’s relaxation of gambling regulation. Betting websites which operate from Caribbean islands such as Barbuda and Antigua will be forced to apply for UK licences. Fixed odds terminals were introduced in 2002 and allow players to bet on roulette, poker and blackjack. The number of machines has soared to 32,000 from 16,380 in 2007. Britons have become so addicted to them that at least £46billion is expected to be staked this year. The Coalition’s all-powerful quad – Mr Cameron, Mr Clegg, George Osborne and Danny Alexander – has agreed to reject a call from the Commons culture committee for there to be fewer restrictions on the machines. Instead, it has ordered a review of stakes, numbers of machines and prize levels. Councils may also be given powers to curb the terminals. Lib Dem Communities Minister Don Foster has campaigned for betting limits to be cut to £2 a spin. ‘For too long, this problem has been swept under the carpet,’ said Mr Foster. ‘There’s no doubt this is ruining people’s lives. Fixed odds betting terminals have incredibly high stakes and prizes. People chase their losses. These machines are getting more and more sophisticated. ‘From telephone calls to gambling helplines, we do know that increasingly these machines are being used by large numbers of people who are saying they are getting into difficulty and need help.’ He told the Daily Mail that young and unemployed men were the most regular players. ‘There are very many in the industry themselves who have concerns about it, though they are very reluctant to say much about it because they are worried about the impact it might have on other parts of the industry,’ he added. ‘Some bookmakers’ shops are now making as much as 70 to 80 per cent of their takings from the machines.’ Mr Foster said the Labour Party had allowed the machines to spread but now admitted this was a mistake. ‘MPs from all parties have been expressing concern,’ he said. ‘As a result of that protest, I am delighted that I can tell you that the Government has agreed at the most senior level that we are now going to conduct a review into the evidence for the need to look again at the levels of stakes and prizes and other issues related to these fixed odds betting terminals. ‘We can look at the level of the stakes, we can look at the number of machines that are allowed, we can look at the spin rate. David Cameron and Nick Clegg are expected to examine a reversal of Labour's relaxation of gambling regulations. 'This is a real victory for all those, including the Daily Mail, that have expressed real concern about these machines, which frankly are an aberration.’ Mr Foster said he favoured a maximum stake of £2, but it would be up to the industry to make a case for higher amounts. He also said the Government would shake up the regulation of offshore gaming websites, saying it was ‘crazy’ that many taking bets from British punters were registered so far away. ‘We intend to have some form of secondary licensing system where if you want to advertise and do business in this country then you have to have a UK imprimatur to</s>",Lib Dems campaign to lower betting limits at terminals.

"Matt Damon said it's hard not to see his three daughters in the eyes of the girls he helps on his visits to the poverty stricken villages in India. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta sat down with Damon and his water.org co-founder, Gary White, to talk about what their organization is hoping to achieve by providing clean water and sanitation to those who need it. ""Our daughters in that situation would be off looking for a water source and hauling water for the family and they would have no prospects for a life or a future,"" Damon said. On premises access to clean water is something only one in four people have in India, according to UNICEF. When Damon got into the water business, he worked with H20 Africa and says he learned a lot. ""I did what I think a lot of people do, which is they kind of get right into the direct impact, like well-digging and how many people can I help if I dig x number of wells,"" Damon said. But he said as his understanding of the issue grew, he realized that charity wasn't going to solve the problem. Together, we can solve the water crisis. He teamed with Gary White, co-founder of WaterPartners, in July 2009 and water.org was born. ""Had I stayed with just drilling wells, I'd have reached thousands of people at this point, but by the end of next year we'll hit 3 million people that we've reached this way,"" Damon said. Water.org is a nonprofit focused on giving access to clean water and sanitation to more of the developing world. What makes the organization different is its WaterCredit Initiative, which provides new financing options for poor people so they can pay for a toilet in their home or connect to an existing water supply. White said he met women in India who were paying 125% interest to loan sharks to get their own toilet or to connect to the public water utilities. They inspired him to create the WaterCredit initiative. Now, he said, these women can get a loan at a much lower rate and still get access to these services. ""So, basically we helped microfinance institutions really discover a new market among some of their existing clients and now we've had over 1.6 million people get access to water and sanitation not through charity but through a microloan. And they're being repaid at 99%,"" White said. In a lot of urban areas the infrastructure already exists. Water pumps right under the feet of people who just can't connect to it. ""It was the recognition that there was a market there for this, and that if we just stopped looking at people as beneficiaries, if we look at them as customers, then we can really unleash their power to solve their own problems,"" Damon said. Damon's passion about water is spilling into every aspect of his life. He's using his celebrity and sense of humor to help spread the word. When he took part in the ice bucket challenge, he did it with toilet water. Before that he proclaimed a strike on toilets, saying ""Until everybody has access to clean water and sanitation, I will not go to the bathroom."" His goal to empower people is serious. He said by gaining access to water and toilets, women and girls gain their time and life back. For many, collecting and scavenging for water is a large part of their day. Freed from those duties they can find a job and earn money to help repay the loan. Desperate, disgusted but proud -- India's human waste removers.

"A British woman was been forced to move home from Australia after discovering she was recorded as a male on her birth registry - and now claims she is technically locked in an 'illegal gay’ marriage. Mother-of-five Kim Walmsley, 49, says her world has been turned upside down after it came to light the registrar wrongly recorded her as a male when she was born in February 1965. Mrs Walmsley says when she first noticed the mistake more than a decade ago when she applied for a full-time Australian visa she 'laughed it off' and thought it would be put right straight away - but after years living in the UK unable to move back she has turned to the Prime Minister for help. Error: Kim Walmsley, 49, disocvered in 2003 that she had been registered as male at birth. Documentation: The details were later amended, but institutions including the Australian immigration office have told her the entry is legally binding - meaning she could not extend her visa. But she was then told the information could not be altered because it is a legal document - which she claims has made her 23-year marriage to husband Jack, 49, invalid. The family, who were living their dream life in Australia, have since been forced to move back to the UK after Mrs Walmsley was unable to renew her passport due to the error. Mrs Walmsley says the cost of the move and the paperwork trying to fight it has cost £150,000 - and the only person left who can help is David Cameron. She said: 'The whole thing is absolutely disgusting. I’ve lived nearly 40 years not realising I was actually registered as a boy and then all of a sudden my whole life fell apart. 'It means my marriage is a complete farce because technically it’s illegal. We had a big white wedding in a church and spent a fortune and it was all for nothing. 'Invalid': A vicar at the church where Mrs Walmsley married told her that the birth certificate error means her wedding is not valid. 'In the eyes of the law we were technically two men marrying and that was against the law at the time'. Following her birth her parents were given a birth certificate correctly stating she was a girl - but it had been wrongly recorded in the register’s office records that she was a male. Mrs Walmsley found out in September 2003 when she ordered a copy of her birth certificate so she could apply for a permanent Australian visa. Although the General Registry Office accepted it was an error they said it was against the law to change it and there was nothing they could do. Mrs Walmsley said: 'Since I found out I have tried everything I can possibly think of to get it changed but it’s like banging your head against a brick wall. 'As far as I know I’m the only person this has happened to and I feel like people don’t understand and nobody wants to help. 'We are a Christian family and it’s a massive problem to me that my marriage is illegal. Wedding: The ceremony marrying Mr and Mrs Walmsley 23 years ago, pictured, is reportedly invalid because of the birth certificate error. Marriage: According to church experts, the marriage recorded in the above certificate is not valid due to the error. 'I want to marry Jack again as husband and wife but how can I when I’m still classed as a boy? It’s a disgrace. It’s clearly an error but due to statuary rules they won’t change it.' The couple contacted five different solicitors and spent money on legal fees as well as the cost of moving back to the UK - around £150,000 in total. They were told that their marriage in August 1991 was illegal and they never should have been allowed to wed. A</s>","Kim Walmsley, 49, was wrongly registered as male when she was born. Mrs Walmsley, from Liverpool, now claims that the decision means her 23-year marriage to her husband is invalid. The error also left her unable to extend her Australian visa, meaning she and her family had to move home. She has now turned to the Prime Minister in order to correct the error.</s> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad> <pad>",<pad> By. Daily Mail Reporter.

"By. Derek Lawrenson. One look at Rory McIlroy told you that a life of splendour and a world of riches is still no protection from the turmoil caused by affairs of the heart. Here was Rory with all the privileges stripped away, just another 25-year-old struggling like so many with true love and all that it means. During his short press conference at Wentworth on Wednesday, he answered one question with the distant look of a man with his mind placed firmly somewhere else. There was one awful moment during another when he looked like he might lose it completely. In the balance: Rory McIlroy's split from fiancee Caroline Wozniacki has threatened his chances in the PGA Championship. Happy couple: McIlroy proposed to tennis player Wozniacki in December. Going steady: The pair had been an item for over two years. Down: The pair (pictured last week) only sent out invitations to their wedding at the weekend. This was McIlroy as we have not seen. him, wrought and strung-out. A man who did not appear in any fit mental. state to make a decent fist of playing in the European Tour’s flagship. event, the BMW PGA Championship which, lest we forget, begins on Thursday. Who. knows the reason for the break-up, which comes only a few days after. the wedding invitations were sent out. Less than a month ago, Caroline. Wozniacki was talking of starting a family and McIlroy was tweeting a. photo of their scenic location for dinner only last Friday. Let us hope there really is nothing more to it than the official explanation of cold feet. But the news certainly caught everyone cold on the practice ground. ‘I’m surprised, I think we all must be,’ said Luke Donald. Typical. McIlroy, to front up and answer questions when things have gone wrong. What he must surely be asking himself, though, is why things are always. going off track.Here was one more twist to the legend: ‘It always seems. to happen to Rory.’ One of these days he will have a season where all the talk is about golf but it doesn’t look as if it will be any time soon. Nice to see you: McIlroy is offered words of wisdom from television legend Sir Bruce Forsyth. In awe: Man United fan McIlroy played alongside Phil Neville, Teddy Sheringham and Peter Schmeichel. Hero status: McIlroy was distracted by Sheringham, who won the Treble with United in 1999. Gobsmacked: Schmeichel won five Premier League titles during a successful stay at Old Trafford. Gift: Neville presented McIlroy with a United shirt which appeared to brighten his mood. The main man: Sheringham, Schmeichel and Neville watch on McIlroy takes a shot. This. time last year the break-up in question was with his manager, Conor. Ridge. The year before that he made the startling confession that he had. taken his eye off the ball. ‘I’ve. spent enough time with lawyers this year to last me a lifetime,’ he. said wistfully last November. Now, as we head into the meat of the. season with this prestigious event followed by three majors in as many. months before the Ryder Cup in September, here we go again. Fifteen. months ago, Ernie Els got to play with Rory when his mind was whirling. so much he walked off the course at the Honda Classic after nine holes.</s>","McIlroy looked affected by the split from his fiancee Caroline Wozniacki.

"Worry: Of concern is the HFEA's claim that the donations of eggs and sperm must be increased in order to meet the growing demand for IVF treatment (posed by model) Women who give their eggs to help childless couples will get a £750 payment in an attempt to boost the number of donors. Hundreds of 'fertility tourists' are driven abroad each year to seek eggs or sperm in countries which make more generous payments than allowed in Britain. Childless couples, lesbians and single women are also using unregulated websites in desperate efforts to start a family. Until now there has been a cap on expenses of £250 for egg and sperm donors per cycle of treatment. But many experts claimed the payment failed to properly reward women for taking extra risks from the drugs involved. The fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, agreed yesterday to approve a fixed sum payment for the first time to stop donors being out of pocket and deter the use of ‘rogue’ sites. But critics said the decision was ‘disgraceful’, saying poor, vulnerable women would be tempted to risk their health for cash. A change in UK law five years ago which requires sperm or egg donors to reveal their identities to any children born as a result is also blamed by some experts for long waiting lists. Juliet Tizzard, HFEA head of policy, said: ‘Shortage is undeniably an issue. Patients are still waiting for donor conception treatment and are increasingly going overseas.’ Payment: The £750 figure for egg donors is the same as that used in Spain, for instance, while the £35 for sperm donations matches that of Denmark. She warned about the increase of unregulated websites that claim to introduce donors to recipients. ‘Some are making private arrangements where they are organising sperm donation among themselves. We have already written to these websites to highlight our concerns about the risks that sperm donors and recipients can put themselves at.’ CURRENT SYSTEM. Women and men can claim expenses such as travel costs and loss of earnings of up to £61.28 per day. There is a cap of £250. NEW SYSTEM. Women. would receive a fixed sum of £750 and also be able to claim for. excessive expenses. The figure would put the UK on a par with the. Spanish system. Sperm donors would receive a fixed sum of £35. Sperm donors will in future get a fixed sum of £35 per clinic visit, which could see them netting around £525 based on a typical series of 15 visits. The fixed sums include expenses, receipts will not have to be produced, and donors will still only be allowed to help create a maximum of ten families – a rule that is likely to limit women to a single donation of eggs in return for £750. But some experts believe higher payments, which already exist in other European countries, may attract the wrong type of donor and breach EU guidelines that donation should be voluntary. HFEA chairman Professor Lisa Jardine denied the payments would be an incentive to people who were ‘merely financially motivated’. But Dr David King, director of Human Genetics Alert, said surveys showed the British public opposed cash payments and the HFEA was using a loophole by insisting they were called compensation. He said: ‘This is a disgraceful decision which puts young women’s health at risk. By creating a financial incentive the HFEA is ensuring that the risks of egg donation are dumped on young women in financial difficulties. ‘Anyone who think £750 is not a financial incentive knows nothing about life on income support or with your students fees tripled. ‘We already know that a £750 payment, as they have in Spain, creates a financial incentive which explains the surplus of egg donors there.

The pair were playing in the Diamond Games in Antwerp with Henin testing herself after being out since mid-season with an elbow ligament injury. Her last competitive match was her fourth round loss to Clijsters at Wimbledon in June. Clijsters, fresh from retaining her U.S. Open crown then rounding off her season by claiming the WTA Championships in Doha, proved too sharp for Henin. She won the first set 6-1 in just 25 minutes, but Henin recovered from falling an early break down to win the second 6-3 to level. That set in train a super tiebreaker, with the first player to 10 points winning the match and it was Clijsters who pulled ahead.

"Father-of-six Tyree Landrum was driving to one of his three jobs when he came across a line of Ferguson protesters blocking the road in the middle of the San Diego rush hour. Furious that the demonstrators might make him late to work and risk him getting fired, he decided to get out of his car on the I-5 in La Jolla to confront the group of students. He then told a photographer for ABC News 10: 'If I don't get there, I'm going to get fired. I've got six f****** kids to feed.' Mr Landrum's reaction on Wednesday has since gone viral, and has drummed up support from hundreds on social media. Meanwhile demonstrations have continued across the country in the wake of the decision by a grand jury not to indict Darren Wilson who shot unarmed teen Michael Brown. Scroll down for video. Anger: Father-of-six Tyree Landrum shows his frustration as he arrives at a group of Ferguson protesters on the I-5 in San Diego who are making him late for work. Frustration: Hundreds of motorists were prevented from getting to their final destination because of the demonstration during the morning rush hour. Many other drivers around him shared his anger, including nurses in their scrubs en route the hospital, and got out of their cars. Mr Landrum then approached one protester standing with a bullhorn shouting: 'No justice, no peace.' He ripped the device from him and replied: 'Hey, I feel you; we ain't got no justice either.' A woman then shouted 'arrest them' before a unit of California Highway Patrol and San Diego police arrived at the scene - half an hour after the protest started. As officers began talking to them, one motorists said: 'You're spending the night in jail! That's right, you're spending the night in jail tonight.' Face-to-face: Mr Landrum, who works three jobs in a bid to provide for his six children, then walked up to the protesters to confront them. Tussle: At one point, Mr Landrum wrestles the bullhorn from one of the demonstrators. However they were not arrested because police said the protest was peaceful. Mr Landrum's rant to the protesters went viral on Facebook, with many people coming out in support. Reflecting on his actions, he said that he didn't consider himself a hero but an everyday person and regrets losing his temper. 'I'm nobody special, just doing what I thought was right,' he told the station. 'And then he put this bullhorn in my face, and I'm like get this bullhorn out of my face. At that point, I was confused, frustrated and completely angry.' Mr Landrum was late to work, however his boss reportedly understood the situation and did not take any action.

"By. Suzannah Hills. PUBLISHED:. 00:14 EST, 13 March 2013. |. UPDATED:. 03:55 EST, 13 March 2013. Lord Sugar can't admit when he has 'done something wrong' and won't ever be seen to back down, a tribunal was told yesterday. The claim was made during the employment tribunal of former Apprentice winner Stella English, 34, who is suing him for constructive dismissal. Ms English, from Whitstable,. Kent, claims she was treated as an 'overpaid lackey' after being handed a. £100,000 contract for winning series six of the BBC1 show in 2010. Lord Sugar told the East. London Tribunal Centre he has no case to answer but Ms English's lawyer. told the court he just can't admit he may be in the wrong. Legal battle: Stella English, pictured left, is claiming constructive. dismissal by Sir Alan Sugar, pictured right. Her lawyer told the employment tribunal hearing the business tycoon can't admit when he's in the wrong. Philippa Jackson, representing Ms. English, said: 'He's not going to be seen to be backing down. 'He doesn't think much of employees running off and complaining - they should get on with it. 'What's more, he doesn't like it when people cross him. That became evident in the course of his evidence. 'He doesn't even attempt to countenance he might have committed a breach and done something wrong.' She said as Ms English was Lord Sugar's. apprentice, she had the right to expect 'a degree of mentoring' during. her time working for him - something she alleges was lacking. For there to be 'a relationship of trust. and confidence' between an employer and employee, both sides must. consider the job to be 'a genuine occupation', added Ms Jackson. Addressing the fact that Ms English did. not make any complaints about the way she claims to have been treated. before resigning, Ms Jackson said: 'She was clearly in a difficult. situation. She was overpaid. She's come into an established company in. very unusual circumstances. 'All that is relevant in understanding why she did not raise any issues.' Row: Lord Alan Sugar, pictured left, said. that his former employee, pictured right, was is a 'headline-grabber' deliberately 'courting' the media to try and ruin his reputation. Lord Sugar met his former employee Stella English (second from left, front row) on the series that was aired in 2010 - but now she is suing him. But Lord Sugars' representative Seamus Sweeney argued Ms English was 'courting' the media to ruin the tycoon's reputation and compared her to the wife of Chris Huhne. He said: 'The claimant has, in the. eyes of Lord Sugar, deliberately courted the media with a view of. damaging his reputation.' He told how Ms English had'sold her. story' to the press several times and accused her of being a 'headline-grabber', deliberately sensationalising aspects of her. evidence. Referring to yesterday's sentencing of. former Lib Dem cabinet member Chris Huhne, Mr Sweeney said Lord Justice. Sweeney - who is no relation to him - described how Vicky Pryce using. the media as a weapon. He told the tribunal the same was true. of Ms English, adding: 'Using</s>","Apprentice winner Stella English, 34, is suing him for constructive dismissal. Lord Sugar told the East.

"(CNN) -- You can call 18-year-old Marc Davis a veteran of the racetrack. On everything from BMX bikes and Bandolero cars to Legends and Late Models, Davis has steadily moved up the ranks of competitive racing. Marc Davis, left, talks strategy with crew chief Billy Venturini in Concord, North Carolina. ""I've been racing for 13 years. Started out when I was 6 years old,"" said Davis, who is set to race this month as NASCAR's only current African-American driver/owner. Two years ago, Davis signed a six-year contract with the Joe Gibbs Race team as a developmental driver. But then the economy went south, and Davis was let go in a cost-cutting move. He was another casualty of the recession. ""We got bit by the economy,"" Davis said. Mike Herman Jr. has worked as Davis' coach for the past two years and feels that NASCAR could be in store for even rougher financial times. ""In my honest opinion, I feel like motorsports is a year away from feeling the brunt of the recession."" Davis' father, Harry, breaks it down further and says it's all about sponsorship money. ""Sponsors are harder to find. Teams want more money. So now instead of being unemployed, Marc is now self-employed, moving forward and racing his own team."" Watch Marc Davis at the track ». Davis formed his own two-car team to compete in this year's Nationwide Series, with his first entry set for Bristol, Tennessee, on March 21. His team is being funded by family and a few sponsors, not an easy feat when it costs a minimum of $75,000 to enter a Nationwide Series race. In fact, a two-car team is considered a skeletal operation by NASCAR standards. Some of the better-funded racing teams have 12 to 20 cars at their disposal. But Davis' crew chief, Billy Venturini, says a two-car team can work for the time being. ""It's a start-up deal, but I think with the short schedule he's got, I think we'll be in fine shape."" Several NASCAR teams have scaled back on their budgets, and Davis feels that it actually levels the playing field a bit. ""With a lower-budget team, you have a better shot of making races and winning races to be more competitive, since a lot of the higher teams have cut back their budgets as well."" NASCAR spokesman Ramsey Poston agrees with Davis and goes one step further. ""Several teams are watching their spending, and that brings more parity in the sport, with the result being a more competitive and enjoyable product for race fans."" Davis plans to compete in a number of Nationwide Series races before moving on to the Sprint Cup Series. ""I want to progress through the Nationwide Series and enter the Sprint Cup Series and win championships and hopefully be a full-time owner years down the road, so I think everything's going in the right direction,"" Davis said.

A Ferrari-driving millionaire was last night being quizzed by police on suspicion of shooting a solicitor in the face with a sawn-off shotgun. Property developer Michael Chudleigh, 61, was arrested 35 minutes after a gunman walked into the lawyer’s office in the market town of Devizes, Wiltshire. The victim, father-of-three James Ward, 58 – described as a ‘lovely’ family man who would do anything for anybody – was shot at his desk and left fighting for his life. Suspect: Michael Chudleigh at his house in Wiltshire in 2007. The 62-year-old has been named locally as the man arrested by police in connection with the shooting of solicitor James Ward in Devizes yesterday. Last night Mr Ward’s wife Nicola. Morris, who also works at his firm, was keeping a hospital bedside vigil. along with their children. Police are investigating whether Chudleigh bore a grudge against the solicitor. It is understood that the tycoon was. recently evicted when his stunning £2million converted farmhouse in the. tiny village of Rowde, near Devizes, was repossessed. The Tudor-style ‘dream home’,. Kingfisher House, boasts five bedrooms, marble bathrooms, and a 62ft. heated outdoor swimming pool with a thatched bar. Shot: Solicitor James Ward who is fighting for his life after being shot in the head at his office in Wiltshire. He lived there with Francine Whale,. his married business partner, and once explained the arrangement by. saying he she had initially allowed him to keep his ‘very rare Ferrari’ parked there, then he moved in himself. Neighbours claimed Chudleigh had been. evicted in April after falling on hard times.One, who asked not want to. be named, said they had seen armed police swooping on the property. Four staff members were in Mr Ward’s. offices on Monday afternoon, when the shooting took place. Two members. of the public – including an off-duty paramedic – rushed in to try to. help Mr Ward before he was airlifted to hospital. Last night police were granted an extra 12 hours to question Chudleigh. Detective Chief Inspector Ian. Saunders, from Wiltshire Police, said: ‘This clearly is a very tragic. incident. The victim is currently at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol with. life-threatening head injuries. ‘The man who has been arrested was found in the village of Rowde shortly afterwards. ‘He was sitting a short distance away. from his car. We found him to be in possession of a weapon which we. believe was the same shotgun used in the attack on Mr Ward.’ Chudleigh is well-known in the area,. following a 2007 story that revealed how he bought his married lover. Rachel Leigh a £100,000 Ferrari, a Rolex and jewellery, only to discover. she was secretly also cheating on him with one of his friends. On discovering the second affair, he stormed round to her home and confronted both her and her taxi driver husband.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor years ago said she was a ""product of affirmative action"" when she was admitted to prestigious universities, but defended the contributions she offered as a Hispanic woman to classroom and workplace diversity. ""I am the perfect affirmative action baby,"" Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor said in the 1990s. The statements were part of newly released videos of speeches and panel discussions dating from the mid-1980s that the 54-year-old federal judge provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will begin confirmation hearings July 13. The remarks offer often-candid insights into the New York native's views on the law, growing up poor in a Bronx housing project, juggling a career and a social life, and her 1980s divorce. In an early 1990s panel with two other female judges, Sotomayor talked about her educational background and how it helped her in her job as a federal trial judge in Manhattan. ""I am a product of affirmative action,"" she said. ""I am the perfect affirmative action baby. I am Puerto Rican, born and raised in the south Bronx. My test scores were not comparable to my colleagues at Princeton and Yale. Not so far off so that I wasn't able to succeed at those institutions."" She said that using ""traditional numbers"" from test scores, ""it would have been highly questionable if I would have been accepted."" The female panel members politely objected to her characterizations of how she overcame such obstacles, pointing out she graduated from law school with honors and was on the prestigious law review. Sotomayor countered that those were signs test scores alone do not offer the full measure of a person's capability. Test scores, she said, often can be the result of ""cultural biases."" In a 1986 interview with ABC News profiling young female professionals, Sotomayor said she constantly had to deal with subtle forms of discrimination, particularly when it came to public perceptions. ""I found in my experiences that it's not that men are consciously discriminating against promoting women, but I do believe as people we have self-images about what's good,"" she said. ""What's quote-unquote a 'good' lawyer, doctor, or whatever the profession is. And if you're a male who grew up professionally in a male-dominated profession then your image of what a good lawyer is is a male image."" Years later on the federal bench, Sotomayor said she encountered similar treatment from older white men particularly, who seemed to speak longer to her than other lawyers. She said the impression she got was that was because she was a woman and a minority. Sotomayor has been criticized by some conservatives for her remarks on diversity, and her 2001 comment that she ""would hope that a wise Latina woman, with the richness of her experiences, would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" In the legal panel, she rejected suggestions that minorities should accept ""selection by merit alone."" She noted, ""It is critical that we promote diversity"" by giving women and minorities more opportunities in the law and the judiciary. ""Since I have difficulty defining merit and what merit alone means -- and in any context, whether it's judicial or otherwise -- I accept that different experiences in and of itself, bring merit to the system,"" she said. ""I think it brings to the system more of a sense of fairness when these litigants see people like myself on the bench."" As a judge she offered a variety of thoughts on how a judge should act on the bench. ""I have to unhook myself from my emotional responses and try to stay within my unemotional objective person</s>","Remarks from an early 1990s panel with two other female judges.

"'Hey, is your dad the bass player in INXS?' There it was... the standard question during my weekly social event.

Lucy-Mae Beers describes how her father (pictured with her as a child) did not accept it when INXS's fame 'fell to the wayside' Lucy-Mae Beers (left) says her relationship with her father (right) is now conducted via email. Little do my acquaintances at the bar know my contact with my dad is purely through email... less than a dozen per year. My responses (if not silence) are melancholy answers, much like how I respond to sloppy pick-up attempts or family friends who ask the age-old questions such as 'what are you studying?' or 'what are your life goals?' My father is a stranger to me, and does not deserve any personal rhetoric, especially through superficial email. Lucy-Mae Beers (left), with her sister, Matilda, has told how her father is a'stranger' to her. INXS at a hotel room in Glasgow circa 1988 - from left Michael Hutchence, Kirk Pengilly, Jon Farriss, Tim Farriss, Garry Gary Beers and Andrew Farris. Lucy was raised by her mother Jodie (left) and says she has 'a very fortunate life' However, there was an occasion recently when I did manage to find a heated reaction. A mere few hours after the much<unk> awaited INXS miniseries: 'Never Tear Us Apart,' aired in Melbourne, I had a lovely egotistical email in my inbox asking:<unk> 'What did you think of Hugh Sheridan playing myself?' Much like the INXS autobiography, the series failed on all accounts to factually explain Garry's personal life – not to mention his Peter Pan syndrome. Lucy and her sister Matilda grew up on a NSW farm with their father when he wasn't touring. Lucy writes that her father Garry has 'five children in three different countries' Lucy writes that her dad is 'now married to the woman who used to wait for him outside of gigs while his family were inside' The lovable Hugh Sheridan, playing my father, Garry 'Gary', rationalises sleeping with a backup singer because he was 'lonely' and'she was beautiful'. There you go folks, it's all justified when you see a beautiful woman and you're lonely on tour, while your pregnant wife was at home with a brand new Harley Davidson as a gift for your return. The series seemed to conveniently leave out the fact that Garry has five children in three different countries and is now married to the woman who used to wait for him outside of gigs while his family were inside. Or that the fetus in the opening scene of 'Never Tear Us Apart' - soon to be me, has mostly grown up without a father.

"By. Emma Reynolds and Anthony Bond. Last updated at 12:01 AM on 25th January 2012. With parts of Britain already covered by snow and ice forecasters have warned of a 24-hour cold snap. Severe weather warnings have been issued for many areas with up to four inches of snow expected to fall on higher ground in Scotland and northern England. One of the first places to be hit was County Durham in the north-east, with residents waking to find heavy snowfall and ice. Bleak: A walker struggles through the snowy landscape of rural Northumberland. Forecasters had warned of a 24-hour cold snap with snow in Scotland and northern England. Extreme: A motorist edges forward cautiously through Otterburn Ranges, Northumberland. Wintry: Residents in parts of the north east woke up to snow this morning. This snowy scene was in Tow Law, County Durham. Having fun: This woman in Tow Law clearly enjoyed the snowfall. She may be disappointed by predictions that the snow is a'short-lived event' With temperatures yesterday hovering only just above freezing for many parts of the country,. including London, forecasters warned that ice could create hazardous. driving conditions. Dan. Williams, from. the Met Office, said it would be a'short-lived event'. Milder. temperatures of about 10C are expected to return but with heavy rain. likely in some areas. Britain has basked in unusually balmy. temperatures over the last week with the country on course for one of. the mildest winters since records began 350 years ago. But forecasters warned that in the coming weeks the unseasonably warm weather may not last, with easterly. winds causing snowstorms and freezing temperatures to rip through the. country again. Mr Williams said: 'If we continue to get winds coming off the. Atlantic from a westerly direction, these will bring mild air over the. UK. 'But if the wind changes to an easterly flow, it has the potential to bring cold air from continental Europe. 'This is what happened in December 2010,. which was very cold because we had an easterly flow for almost a month. 'When that happens, any precipitation becomes snow and we had lots of. snow and freezing weather.' The average temperature from December. 1 to January 15 has been 5.5C, where the warmest winter. in history, in 1868-69, topped that at 6.8C. At the weekend, families. played in parks and took walks in the countryside as the mercury soared. to a summery 13.5C peak in Otterbourne, Hampshire. Snowdrops have been in bloom since January 4, earlier than the country has seen in five years. Improvement: This three-day forecast shows how the weather will improve as the week progresses. Hazardous: Severe weather warnings have been issued for many areas today with up to four inches of snow expected to fall on higher ground in Scotland and northern England. Gloomy outlook: Forecasters warned that easterly winds could cause snowstorms and freezing temperatures to rip through the country. Tricky conditions: Motorists in the north east were slowed down due to the wintry weather. Forecasters say rain that moved across the east of the UK yesterday is likely to turn to sleet and snow across northern and eastern areas. This could result in 1-2inches of snow on land above 200-300 metres with as much as 4ins on land above 400 metres. There could also be a more slushy form of snow down to about 100 metres.
