"In a cowardly attack, Rebel Alliance Terrorists used photon explosives on the starbase's experimental reactor, triggering a chain reaction which destroyed the station. My mother turned the program off and we sat in silence for a moment with only the hum of the compressors from the floor below to fill the moment. `` Isn't he a little short for a stormtrooper? '' : We interrupt `` The Real Housewives of Naboo '' to bring you this special bulletin ; reports are coming in from the Yavin system that the Imperial Navy's research starbase for Dimensional Elasticity And Temporal Heuristics has been destroyed in a terrorist attack by a fringe group of traitors calling themselves `` The Rebel Alliance. ''   In a cowardly attack, Rebel Alliance Terrorists used photon explosives on the starbase's experimental reactor, triggering a chain reaction which destroyed the station. At this point we are unsure how many were killed but the death toll is likely to be in excess of a million souls. Additional casualties are expected in the Yavin system as fallout from the runaway reaction which destroyed the starbase settles on the surrounding....   My mother turned the program off and we sat in silence for a moment with only the hum of the compressors from the floor below to fill the moment.   `` A million dead '' she whispered. She looked at my father, a spoon still clutched in his right hand, a thin trickle of soup dribbling into a his bowl. `` You could have been on there! ''   `` Now Karen... ''   `` Don't 'now Karen'me! I told you I didn't want you working those military contracts! I told you I didn't want you on Imperial ships! The risk is too much! You have a family to take care of and what would your son do if something happened to you? ''   `` The academy ''   `` He is NOT going to the Stormtrooper Academy! ''   `` It was good enough for me, why not him? It's an honorable profession! ''   `` Isn't he a little short for a stormtrooper? '' my sister piped in.   `` SHUT UP! '' At least we could all agree on something.   `` Besides, '' I added, `` I don't want to be a Stormtrooper. ''   `` And why not? '' My father turned on me, eyes suddenly hard and flinty in the blue glare of the kitchen's industrial lights.   `` I don't think I can serve with them if I don't agree with what the Empire is doing! ''   `` Oh here we go again

''   The pair walked through the overgrown playground, the weeds clinging to the metal and plastic structures while vines tangled themselves around jungle gyms and spider domes. The narrow asphalt path was cracked from numerous frosts, the once smooth surface more akin to broken cobbles now thanks to the freezing and thawing cycles that afflicted this part of the world.   Some forty yards away a man dressed in Pre-Arrival clothes slowly and unerringly pushed an empty swing, the creaking chains groaning as it swung back and forth. He wore a fine suit with leather shoes, a bright watch shining on his left wrist. He looked like some stockbroker or banker, back when those professions still existed in better, peaceful times.   `` What is he doing here? '' Faith asked, a small arm had linked itself through one of Flint's, clinging to him tight as they moved through the ruins of a human town.   `` He's an Echo, a fragment of memory and soul that hasn't moved on. At a guess his child used to go to this school when you elves Arrived. They likely died early on, and him soon after ; he just hasn't gotten the message. ''   Faith shuddered at the thought. There were few things as anathemic to the fey as ghosts, a failure to return to the veil and be at peace. Humans seemed more predisposed to falling victim to the sins of fear, desire and regret.   `` What can we do? '' she asked.   `` Nothing. Whoever he was, he has to exorcise his own personal demons.

"A disease had afflicted Earth in the 21st century ; one which spread as though it were highly contagious, but the contagion itself was not one strictly bound by viral or bacterial activity. When those who lived began to realise the importance of the belief in oneself -- the purpose of being, to actively have faith in oneself -- children became at once symbols of hope and of eternity. : A disease had afflicted Earth in the 21st century ; one which spread as though it were highly contagious, but the contagion itself was not one strictly bound by viral or bacterial activity. It was one which emanated from the core of the being itself : the matter of belief, specifically the belief in oneself.   After the affliction occurred many people died. It did not happen so much in areas where religious philosophy concerning the self in relation to God was popular : places such as Asia and the Near East, even parts of Africa, did not suffer so much. Another very odd thing was that the natural world thrived as though protected from such a strange disease. The places which suffered the stale depths of this affliction were areas of Western philosophy and practicality ; places where the belief in oneself was weak, where the person was not inhabited by self-faith but the lack thereof. The disease had many names : some places called it `` God's Judgement '' ; others believed it was brought on by the sins of the world ; some were in search of the reincarnation of Jesus, or an incarnation of Satan ; the paganites called it, in one way or another, a reclamation of nature on behalf of the eternal life-being.   It was a rather odd time. Many elderly people passed away suddenly -- it was a very quick and widespread phenomenon ; abandoned grandparents and homeless veterans reclined on sofas and street curbs alike, the world passing them by with caution. Not all of the elders of the world passed away, but the ones which were alive were avoided, in the belief that they were the ones who held the epidemic. And then it began to happen to those with few purpose ; those who did not do much for themselves or their neighbours. These people were not all homebodies, they were not all incapacitated ; some of them were terminally ill, but not all who were terminally ill died ; some of them were social motivators, people with purpose, but then it came about that perhaps these people felt that they were without.   Children were never affected, which brought a sort of social revolution. When those who lived began to realise the importance of the belief in oneself -- the purpose of being, to actively have faith in oneself -- children became at once symbols of hope and of eternity. Around the world, children were cherished by their parents more : they were not beaten or made to feel guilty, nor were they chastised for their regressions. Rather, children were given the gift of purpose which for many years their ancestors had forgotten : that God is something found from within, that the numinous is found in the content of the universe, and that the content of the universe is within the self.   `` To believe in God is to believe ; to have faith is to believe that God believes in you.

Her loneliness wilted her down to skin and bones with the only remedy being reunification with her family. : She's gone now. Visor lady. Some people say that she relocated to another city because she grew tired of the notoriety she was developing around the college city of Davis, California. For years she was anonymous and minded her own business but a little thing called the internet was created in the 90's and subsequently the city of Davis'own wikipage. The following link is her :   http : //daviswiki.org/Visor_Lady   Now to describe my empathy for this woman i must also divulge that i have quite a soft spot for elder women. I believe elder men can manage a more solitary life better than women. My view particularly comes from my relationship with my own Grandma. When world war II brought over seas from the island of the Philippines, she was left alone while she waited for her children and husband to come later on. Her loneliness wilted her down to skin and bones with the only remedy being reunification with her family. As she grew older and took care of all of her grandchildren including myself, she became the mother to us all while our own parents were trying to make it as immigrants.   We all grew up and unfortunately so did my Grandmother. We lived as Americans and more than often it was the opposite than the native Philippines. In the Philippines she was never alone. As an older woman in America, she later confessed that sometimes she felt so lonely that it hurt, and her hands could not stop shaking.   So you see, one can say that I'm a bit biased when I look at the Visor Lady. But who am i to look at that woman and feel pity when that woman may not need or want it at all.   For one, she seems perfectly content to eat her coffee cakes while listening to the radio as it played its classical tunes

'' I said.   His wisdom astounded me, and he said.   > Shut   > Down   > EVERYTHING!   Madagascar self-quarantined itself, and the world thought we were insane. But they didn't know about our worldwide intelligence network, greater than the CIA, KGB, and MOSSAD combined at their peak. He knew the disease, the disease known as `` super-awesome-mega-ebola-death '', would kill us all if we didn't act quickly.   Our intelligence network extended so far, we found out what was next to our flat world. It was a website, called `` 9GAG ''. Instantly, we knew that we would live forever, as even we knew that any retard that browsed 9GAG couldn't beat one of the [ hardest games on the internet. ] ( http :

''   The pair walked through the overgrown playground, the weeds clinging to the metal and plastic structures while vines tangled themselves around jungle gyms and spider domes. The narrow asphalt path was cracked from numerous frosts, the once smooth surface more akin to broken cobbles now thanks to the freezing and thawing cycles that afflicted this part of the world.   Some forty yards away a man dressed in Pre-Arrival clothes slowly and unerringly pushed an empty swing, the creaking chains groaning as it swung back and forth. He wore a fine suit with leather shoes, a bright watch shining on his left wrist. He looked like some stockbroker or banker, back when those professions still existed in better, peaceful times.   `` What is he doing here? '' Faith asked, a small arm had linked itself through one of Flint's, clinging to him tight as they moved through the ruins of a human town.   `` He's an Echo, a fragment of memory and soul that hasn't moved on. At a guess his child used to go to this school when you elves Arrived. They likely died early on, and him soon after ; he just hasn't gotten the message. ''   Faith shuddered at the thought.

"A disease had afflicted Earth in the 21st century ; one which spread as though it were highly contagious, but the contagion itself was not one strictly bound by viral or bacterial activity. When those who lived began to realise the importance of the belief in oneself -- the purpose of being, to actively have faith in oneself -- children became at once symbols of hope and of eternity. : A disease had afflicted Earth in the 21st century ; one which spread as though it were highly contagious, but the contagion itself was not one strictly bound by viral or bacterial activity. It was one which emanated from the core of the being itself : the matter of belief, specifically the belief in oneself.   After the affliction occurred many people died. It did not happen so much in areas where religious philosophy concerning the self in relation to God was popular : places such as Asia and the Near East, even parts of Africa, did not suffer so much. Another very odd thing was that the natural world thrived as though protected from such a strange disease. The places which suffered the stale depths of this affliction were areas of Western philosophy and practicality ; places where the belief in oneself was weak, where the person was not inhabited by self-faith but the lack thereof. The disease had many names : some places called it `` God's Judgement '' ; others believed it was brought on by the sins of the world ; some were in search of the reincarnation of Jesus, or an incarnation of Satan ; the paganites called it, in one way or another, a reclamation of nature on behalf of the eternal life-being.   It was a rather odd time. Many elderly people passed away suddenly -- it was a very quick and widespread phenomenon ; abandoned grandparents and homeless veterans reclined on sofas and street curbs alike, the world passing them by with caution. Not all of the elders of the world passed away, but the ones which were alive were avoided, in the belief that they were the ones who held the epidemic. And then it began to happen to those with few purpose ; those who did not do much for themselves or their neighbours. These people were not all homebodies, they were not all incapacitated ; some of them were terminally ill, but not all who were terminally ill died ; some of them were social motivators, people with purpose, but then it came about that perhaps these people felt that they were without.   Children were never affected, which brought a sort of social revolution. When those who lived began to realise the importance of the belief in oneself -- the purpose of being, to actively have faith in oneself -- children became at once symbols of hope and of eternity. Around the world, children were cherished by their parents more : they were not beaten or made to feel guilty, nor were they chastised for their regressions. Rather, children were given the gift of purpose which for many years their ancestors had forgotten : that God is something found from within, that the numinous is found in the content of the universe, and that the content of the universe is within the self.   `` To believe in God is to believe ; to have faith is to believe that God believes in you.

Her loneliness wilted her down to skin and bones with the only remedy being reunification with her family. : She's gone now. Visor lady. Some people say that she relocated to another city because she grew tired of the notoriety she was developing around the college city of Davis, California. For years she was anonymous and minded her own business but a little thing called the internet was created in the 90's and subsequently the city of Davis'own wikipage. The following link is her :   http : //daviswiki.org/Visor_Lady   Now to describe my empathy for this woman i must also divulge that i have quite a soft spot for elder women. I believe elder men can manage a more solitary life better than women. My view particularly comes from my relationship with my own Grandma. When world war II brought over seas from the island of the Philippines, she was left alone while she waited for her children and husband to come later on. Her loneliness wilted her down to skin and bones with the only remedy being reunification with her family. As she grew older and took care of all of her grandchildren including myself, she became the mother to us all while our own parents were trying to make it as immigrants.   We all grew up and unfortunately so did my Grandmother. We lived as Americans and more than often it was the opposite than the native Philippines. In the Philippines she was never alone. As an older woman in America, she later confessed that sometimes she felt so lonely that it hurt, and her hands could not stop shaking.   So you see, one can say that I'm a bit biased when I look at the Visor Lady. But who am i to look at that woman and feel pity when that woman may not need or want it at all.   For one, she seems perfectly content to eat her coffee cakes while listening to the radio as it played its classical tunes

''   The pair walked through the overgrown playground, the weeds clinging to the metal and plastic structures while vines tangled themselves around jungle gyms and spider domes. The narrow asphalt path was cracked from numerous frosts, the once smooth surface more akin to broken cobbles now thanks to the freezing and thawing cycles that afflicted this part of the world.   Some forty yards away a man dressed in Pre-Arrival clothes slowly and unerringly pushed an empty swing, the creaking chains groaning as it swung back and forth. He wore a fine suit with leather shoes, a bright watch shining on his left wrist. He looked like some stockbroker or banker, back when those professions still existed in better, peaceful times.   `` What is he doing here? '' Faith asked, a small arm had linked itself through one of Flint's, clinging to him tight as they moved through the ruins of a human town.   `` He's an Echo, a fragment of memory and soul that hasn't moved on. At a guess his child used to go to this school when you elves Arrived. They likely died early on, and him soon after ; he just hasn't gotten the message. ''   Faith shuddered at the thought. There were few things as anathemic to the fey as ghosts, a failure to return to the veil and be at peace. Humans seemed more predisposed to falling victim to the sins of fear, desire and regret.   `` What can we do? '' she asked.   `` Nothing. Whoever he was, he has to exorcise his own personal demons.

"A disease had afflicted Earth in the 21st century ; one which spread as though it were highly contagious, but the contagion itself was not one strictly bound by viral or bacterial activity. When those who lived began to realise the importance of the belief in oneself -- the purpose of being, to actively have faith in oneself -- children became at once symbols of hope and of eternity. : A disease had afflicted Earth in the 21st century ; one which spread as though it were highly contagious, but the contagion itself was not one strictly bound by viral or bacterial activity. It was one which emanated from the core of the being itself : the matter of belief, specifically the belief in oneself.   After the affliction occurred many people died. It did not happen so much in areas where religious philosophy concerning the self in relation to God was popular : places such as Asia and the Near East, even parts of Africa, did not suffer so much. Another very odd thing was that the natural world thrived as though protected from such a strange disease. The places which suffered the stale depths of this affliction were areas of Western philosophy and practicality ; places where the belief in oneself was weak, where the person was not inhabited by self-faith but the lack thereof. The disease had many names : some places called it `` God's Judgement '' ; others believed it was brought on by the sins of the world ; some were in search of the reincarnation of Jesus, or an incarnation of Satan ; the paganites called it, in one way or another, a reclamation of nature on behalf of the eternal life-being.   It was a rather odd time. Many elderly people passed away suddenly -- it was a very quick and widespread phenomenon ; abandoned grandparents and homeless veterans reclined on sofas and street curbs alike, the world passing them by with caution. Not all of the elders of the world passed away, but the ones which were alive were avoided, in the belief that they were the ones who held the epidemic. And then it began to happen to those with few purpose ; those who did not do much for themselves or their neighbours. These people were not all homebodies, they were not all incapacitated ; some of them were terminally ill, but not all who were terminally ill died ; some of them were social motivators, people with purpose, but then it came about that perhaps these people felt that they were without.   Children were never affected, which brought a sort of social revolution. When those who lived began to realise the importance of the belief in oneself -- the purpose of being, to actively have faith in oneself -- children became at once symbols of hope and of eternity. Around the world, children were cherished by their parents more : they were not beaten or made to feel guilty, nor were they chastised for their regressions. Rather, children were given the gift of purpose which for many years their ancestors had forgotten : that God is something found from within, that the numinous is found in the content of the universe, and that the content of the universe is within the self.   `` To believe in God is to believe ; to have faith is to believe that God believes in you.

Her loneliness wilted her down to skin and bones with the only remedy being reunification with her family. : She's gone now. Visor lady. Some people say that she relocated to another city because she grew tired of the notoriety she was developing around the college city of Davis, California. For years she was anonymous and minded her own business but a little thing called the internet was created in the 90's and subsequently the city of Davis'own wikipage. The following link is her :   http : //daviswiki.org/Visor_Lady   Now to describe my empathy for this woman i must also divulge that i have quite a soft spot for elder women. I believe elder men can manage a more solitary life better than women. My view particularly comes from my relationship with my own Grandma. When world war II brought over seas from the island of the Philippines, she was left alone while she waited for her children and husband to come later on. Her loneliness wilted her down to skin and bones with the only remedy being reunification with her family. As she grew older and took care of all of her grandchildren including myself, she became the mother to us all while our own parents were trying to make it as immigrants.   We all grew up and unfortunately so did my Grandmother. We lived as Americans and more than often it was the opposite than the native Philippines. In the Philippines she was never alone. As an older woman in America, she later confessed that sometimes she felt so lonely that it hurt, and her hands could not stop shaking.   So you see, one can say that I'm a bit biased when I look at the Visor Lady. But who am i to look at that woman and feel pity when that woman may not need or want it at all.   For one, she seems perfectly content to eat her coffee cakes while listening to the radio as it played its classical tunes

Within minutes, the battle lasted an hour.   The anti-missile defense Battle-cruiser entered the atmosphere, shields up, and emergency broadcast warnings of an emergency broadcast. Starbase immediately began to orbit away from the Empire.   `` Copy that message to me, Charlie. '' The acting officer stated.   `` Copy that message to me, Charlie.

''   The pair walked through the overgrown playground, the weeds clinging to the metal and plastic structures while vines tangled themselves around jungle gyms and spider domes. The narrow asphalt path was cracked from numerous frosts, the once smooth surface more akin to broken cobbles now thanks to the freezing and thawing cycles that afflicted this part of the world.   Some forty yards away a man dressed in Pre-Arrival clothes slowly and unerringly pushed an empty swing, the creaking chains groaning as it swung back and forth. He wore a fine suit with leather shoes, a bright watch shining on his left wrist. He looked like some stockbroker or banker, back when those professions still existed in better, peaceful times.   `` What is he doing here? '' Faith asked, a small arm had linked itself through one of Flint's, clinging to him tight as they moved through the ruins of a human town.   `` He's an Echo, a fragment of memory and soul that hasn't moved on. At a guess his child used to go to this school when you elves Arrived. They likely died early on, and him soon after ; he just hasn't gotten the message. ''   Faith shuddered at the thought. There were few things as anathemic to the fey as ghosts, a failure to return to the veil and be at peace. Humans seemed more predisposed to falling victim to the sins of fear, desire and regret.   `` What can we do? '' she asked.   `` Nothing. Whoever he was, he has to exorcise his own personal demons.

"A disease had afflicted Earth in the 21st century ; one which spread as though it were highly contagious, but the contagion itself was not one strictly bound by viral or bacterial activity. When those who lived began to realise the importance of the belief in oneself -- the purpose of being, to actively have faith in oneself -- children became at once symbols of hope and of eternity. : A disease had afflicted Earth in the 21st century ; one which spread as though it were highly contagious, but the contagion itself was not one strictly bound by viral or bacterial activity. It was one which emanated from the core of the being itself : the matter of belief, specifically the belief in oneself.   After the affliction occurred many people died. It did not happen so much in areas where religious philosophy concerning the self in relation to God was popular : places such as Asia and the Near East, even parts of Africa, did not suffer so much. Another very odd thing was that the natural world thrived as though protected from such a strange disease. The places which suffered the stale depths of this affliction were areas of Western philosophy and practicality ; places where the belief in oneself was weak, where the person was not inhabited by self-faith but the lack thereof. The disease had many names : some places called it `` God's Judgement '' ; others believed it was brought on by the sins of the world ; some were in search of the reincarnation of Jesus, or an incarnation of Satan ; the paganites called it, in one way or another, a reclamation of nature on behalf of the eternal life-being.   It was a rather odd time. Many elderly people passed away suddenly -- it was a very quick and widespread phenomenon ; abandoned grandparents and homeless veterans reclined on sofas and street curbs alike, the world passing them by with caution. Not all of the elders of the world passed away, but the ones which were alive were avoided, in the belief that they were the ones who held the epidemic. And then it began to happen to those with few purpose ; those who did not do much for themselves or their neighbours. These people were not all homebodies, they were not all incapacitated ; some of them were terminally ill, but not all who were terminally ill died ; some of them were social motivators, people with purpose, but then it came about that perhaps these people felt that they were without.   Children were never affected, which brought a sort of social revolution. When those who lived began to realise the importance of the belief in oneself -- the purpose of being, to actively have faith in oneself -- children became at once symbols of hope and of eternity. Around the world, children were cherished by their parents more : they were not beaten or made to feel guilty, nor were they chastised for their regressions. Rather, children were given the gift of purpose which for many years their ancestors had forgotten : that God is something found from within, that the numinous is found in the content of the universe, and that the content of the universe is within the self.   `` To believe in God is to believe ; to have faith is to believe that God believes in you.

When those who lived began to realise the importance of the belief in oneself -- the purpose of being, to actively have faith in oneself -- children became at once symbols of hope and of eternity. : A disease had afflicted Earth in the 21st century ; one which spread as though it were highly contagious, but the contagion itself was not one strictly bound by viral or bacterial activity. The disease took root in your nervous system, infecting your nervous system with a dormant, latent, and sometimes fatal reaction ; a reaction to pain. The person who had the symptoms became convinced that their actions had been a very big part of a very big project, one that had implications for the entire planet.   The most prominent symptoms were the following :   Laxmenia involuntarily became swollen, and their bodies began to grow hard, to the point of bursting uncontrollably into the atmosphere, and they began to exhibit strange symptoms of interrupted aging, often resulting in inadequate protection.   Pneumonia and multidimensional amnesia were discovered in children who believed themselves to be able to understand reason.   When those who lived began to realise the importance of the belief in oneself -- the purpose of being, to actively have faith in oneself -- children became at once symbols of hope and of eternity.   Decades passed as we reached an end ; the question of whether or not our planet had truly ended, and the question of whether or not our planet had truly ended, were two questions that had never bothering anyone.   1. Why did we end?   2. Why did we end?   The answer to both was that our planet, as a species, began to believe that we had destroyed ourselves. The very concept of man -- the biological and the cultural inheritance of consciousness -- held some critical implications for the entire human race.   3. Why was our planet destroyed?   Pneumonia and multidimensional amnesia were discovered in children who believed themselves to have been able to understand reason. The damage done in their bodies, and the damage done in their minds, led to the extinction of about 90 % of the population.   4. Why was our planet destroyed?   The answer to both was that our planet, as a species, began to believe that we had destroyed ourselves. The extinction event that had occurred due to our continued existence didn't prove to be a result of our destruction, but rather that we had destroyed ourselves <|endoftext|>"
"Some people say that she relocated to another city because she grew tired of the notoriety she was developing around the college city of Davis, California. The following link is her :   http : //daviswiki.org/Visor_Lady   Now to describe my empathy for this woman i must also divulge that i have quite a soft spot for elder women. Her loneliness wilted her down to skin and bones with the only remedy being reunification with her family. : She's gone now. Visor lady. Some people say that she relocated to another city because she grew tired of the notoriety she was developing around the college city of Davis, California. For years she was anonymous and minded her own business but a little thing called the internet was created in the 90's and subsequently the city of Davis'own wikipage. The following link is her :   http : //daviswiki.org/Visor_Lady   Now to describe my empathy for this woman i must also divulge that i have quite a soft spot for elder women. I believe elder men can manage a more solitary life better than women. My view particularly comes from my relationship with my own Grandma. When world war II brought over seas from the island of the Philippines, she was left alone while she waited for her children and husband to come later on. Her loneliness wilted her down to skin and bones with the only remedy being reunification with her family. As she grew older and took care of all of her grandchildren including myself, she became the mother to us all while our own parents were trying to make it as immigrants.   We all grew up and unfortunately so did my Grandmother. We lived as Americans and more than often it was the opposite than the native Philippines. In the Philippines she was never alone. As an older woman in America, she later confessed that sometimes she felt so lonely that it hurt, and her hands could not stop shaking.   So you see, one can say that I'm a bit biased when I look at the Visor Lady. But who am i to look at that woman and feel pity when that woman may not need or want it at all.   For one, she seems perfectly content to eat her coffee cakes while listening to the radio as it played its classical tunes
