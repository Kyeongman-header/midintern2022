"The metal trap clamped shut with a vicious clang , squish , & crunch . DogWelder had his next catch . So many lost pups out on the streets of Hell 's Kitchen & only one man had any idea what to do with them : weld them to the faces of strangers . He could n't be sure that it would fix anything , but it kept him busy after a long day at the pound . Of course , there was cause for caution . A new masked hero had been seen prowling the streets . A man who fought blindfolded . DogWelder knew these streets well & had his latest victim bound in a alleyway 's dumpster a few blocks away . As he dragged the broken mutt to the dumpster , he heard a shout from around the corner . `` Halt ! I am A^r^m^-^F^a^l^l^-^O^f^f^-^B^o^y^ ! '' Whatever it was , it was too far behind him . The blindfolded demon did n't announce his presence so carelessly , so there was little cause for concern . Most likely , it was just another drunk or crack addict roaming the night . DogWelder pulled a bound & squirming banker from the refuse bin . A squirming banker who had denied his loan . A loan for more oxyacetelyne . Oxyacetelyne to weld dogs to faces . Oxyacetelyne was n't cheap . Neither were bear traps . This little banker goes to the dogs . DogWelder pulled down his welder 's mask , donned his gloves , & brought the maimed mutt against the skull of his newest prey . He lit the oxy-fuel torch and lifted it toward the banker 's gagged & pleading face . `` *Halt ! * I am Arm-Fall-Off-Boy ! Release that citizen & drop the puppy ! '' `` What the shit is this ? *No . * '' DogWelder chose to ignore the non-threat in a pink unitard . `` *Halt* , ne'r-do-well ! '' Upon hearing this , the banker appeared more confused than relieved . `` No . '' Dogwelder resumed welding dogs . Arm-Fall-Off-Boy detached his left hand & threw it at DogWelder , slightly skewing his welding mask . `` Okay , loony toon . Check this out . '' DogWelder readjusted his mask & welded the fresh wiggling hand on the pavement onto the banker 's face as well as the dog . `` I said halt ! I need that ! '' Arm-Fall-Off-Boy removed his hand-less left arm & charged toward DogWelder , intending to club him with the shoulder end of the appendage . `` *You* should halt , *Arm*y Boy . '' `` Never ! You 're coming wi -- -*Yowza ! * That *smarts ! * '' Arm-Fall-Off-Boy had tripped another of DogWelder 's bear-traps , crippling his right ankle . `` No matter ! I 'll still apprehend you ! '' He detached his right leg at the knee , leaving it in the trap . He continued his limping approach of the crime-scene with his hand-less arm in hand , ready for battle . `` What the shit ... . '' `` Submit to apprehension ! The 30^th Century will see you pay for your crimes ! '' `` Crimes ? I 'm bringing man & man 's best friend together . Forever . '' DogWelder continued welding dog , face , & hand together without interruption or looking up from the work at hand . The stench of unconventional barbecue wafted throughout the alleyway . `` Smell that ? That 's the 21^st Century , you volitional amputee . '' `` I will see you answer for your transgressions against hound & man ! '' `` I doubt it . '' DogWelder had had enough . He turned the valve on his oxy-fuel tank up to the highest point & walked toward the increasingly limbless & limping do-gooder . As he applied the torch to Arm-Fall-Off-Boy 's face , a blood-curdling scream was set loose , but only for a moment . Arm-Fall-Off-Boy , in a panic , had fallen to pieces emotionally & literally . As a mess of limbs lay about the writhing torso , DogWelder stood in confused awe . He lifted the squirming face from the ground beside its torso & held it in front of his mask . The mouth moved furiously , but without vocal cords no words came out .","DogWelder welded dogs to the faces of strangers.

The blindfolded demon did n't announce his presence so carelessly , so there was little cause for concern . Most likely , it was just another drunk or crack addict roaming the night . DogWelder pulled a bound & squirming banker from the refuse bin . A squirming banker who had denied his loan . A loan for more oxyacetelyne . Oxyacetelyne to weld dogs to faces . Oxyacetelyne was n't cheap . Neither were bear traps . This little banker goes to the dogs . DogWelder pulled down his welder 's mask , donned his gloves , & brought the maimed mutt against the skull of his newest prey . He lit the oxy-fuel torch and lifted it toward the banker 's gagged & pleading face . `` *Halt ! * I am Arm-Fall-Off-Boy ! Release that citizen & drop the puppy ! '' `` What the shit is this ? *No . * '' DogWelder chose to ignore the non-threat in a pink unitard . `` *Halt* , ne'r-do-well ! '' Upon hearing this , the banker appeared more confused than relieved . `` No . '' Dogwelder resumed welding dogs . Arm-Fall-Off-Boy detached his left hand & threw it at DogWelder , slightly skewing his welding mask . `` Okay , loony toon . Check this out . '' DogWelder readjusted his mask & welded the fresh wiggling hand on the pavement onto the banker 's face as well as the dog . `` I said halt ! I need that !

'' `` Submit to apprehension ! The 30^th Century will see you pay for your crimes ! '' `` Crimes ? I 'm bringing man & man 's best friend together . Forever . '' DogWelder continued welding dog , face , & hand together without interruption or looking up from the work at hand . The stench of unconventional barbecue wafted throughout the alleyway . `` Smell that ? That 's the 21^st Century , you volitional amputee . '' `` I will see you answer for your transgressions against hound & man ! '' `` I doubt it . '' DogWelder had had enough . He turned the valve on his oxy-fuel tank up to the highest point & walked toward the increasingly limbless & limping do-gooder . As he applied the torch to Arm-Fall-Off-Boy 's face , a blood-curdling scream was set loose , but only for a moment . Arm-Fall-Off-Boy , in a panic , had fallen to pieces emotionally & literally . As a mess of limbs lay about the writhing torso , DogWelder stood in confused awe . He lifted the squirming face from the ground beside its torso & held it in front of his mask . The mouth moved furiously , but without vocal cords no words came out .","DogWelder welded dogs to the faces of strangers.

'' Arm-Fall-Off-Boy removed his hand-less left arm & charged toward DogWelder , intending to club him with the shoulder end of the appendage . `` *You* should halt , *Arm*y Boy . '' `` Never ! You 're coming wi -- -*Yowza ! * That *smarts ! * '' Arm-Fall-Off-Boy had tripped another of DogWelder 's bear-traps , crippling his right ankle . `` No matter ! I 'll still apprehend you ! '' He detached his right leg at the knee , leaving it in the trap . He continued his limping approach of the crime-scene with his hand-less arm in hand , ready for battle . `` What the shit ... . '' `` Submit to apprehension ! The 30^th Century will see you pay for your crimes ! '' `` Crimes ? I 'm bringing man & man 's best friend together . Forever . '' DogWelder continued welding dog , face , & hand together without interruption or looking up from the work at hand . The stench of unconventional barbecue wafted throughout the alleyway . `` Smell that ? That 's the 21^st Century , you volitional amputee . '' `` I will see you answer for your transgressions against hound & man ! '' `` I doubt it . '' DogWelder had had enough . He turned the valve on his oxy-fuel tank up to the highest point & walked toward the increasingly limbless & limping do-gooder . As he applied the torch to Arm-Fall-Off-Boy 's face , a blood-curdling scream was set loose , but only for a moment . Arm-Fall-Off-Boy , in a panic , had fallen to pieces emotionally & literally . As a mess of limbs lay about the writhing torso , DogWelder stood in confused awe . He lifted the squirming face from the ground beside its torso & held it in front of his mask . The mouth moved furiously , but without vocal cords no words came out .","DogWelder welded dogs to the faces of strangers. He could n't be sure that it would fix anything, but it kept him busy after a long day at the pound. A new masked hero had been seen prowling the streets.

"# # # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap ) It was a fresh vintage of his own creation , picked from fields lush and infused with the life of the surrounding areas . The soil outside that carefully crafted zone was dead and dry under such influence , rocky and terse to a pale comparison of its former glory , but inside the seals and weaves of the magic 's touch : The ground was vibrant . Life blossomed beneath the simple game of concentrations , held in place by overwhelming magical prowess of a Mage beyond his years . Wine Harvesting was one of the few tasks of seeming normality that Gillian still took seriously . Perhaps it came hand in hand with immortality , but Gillian had been a functional alcoholic longer than most people could trace their family lines . After the first thousand years , sleep alone will no longer get one 's mind far enough from the world to rest with contentment ; subtle assistance is often required , lest the dullness of reality seep in deep . Some rare few might argue the semantics of the first of such statements : Certainly there was the odd noble-blood fanatic who had their dusty old lineage manuscripts to point them back a few thousand years or so . Magic imbued parchment could stand the passage of time almost as well as he himself could , and there were still some people of that nature and art scattered or sprinkled about here and there among the outer kingdoms . At a general average though , Gillian knew it was the truth . A few thousand years and counting , but he still appreciated a good Wine as much as when he 'd first discovered the beverage . As he strolled down the perfectly crafted steps to the cellar of his grand and noble keep , he let his fingers trace out along the many perfectly formed glass bottles , the wooden shelves and barrels made and imbued with magics of keeping , preserved from time and ages . The perfect glow of glass and colors greeted his eyes , smiling jewels in the cool crypt of earth . None else but Gillian himself were permitted to enter this place without permission , and rarely did he permit them in any such case . Only once every dozen years or so , he might allow a few hand selected to carry down what seemed most promising- but no more often than that . It was a capsule in time , this basement . Many things rested in its cool embrace , not simply wine but also the occasional shipment from the Dwarven Whiskey , barreled from the Far Western Mountains of his territories . It was fair to say that Gillian preferred wine dramatically to the few competitors offered , but he was n't one to rule things out- although with honesty he 'd never been much for liquors . Try as he might to blend the burning sensations in his throat from the liquids with herb and pipe , they were almost always too unpleasant for him to savor . It was n't the pain that bothered him to such a degree , considering Gillian could just magic that away without a thought , but the flavor . For some reason he 'd yet to find a spell that might mask such flammable tastes . Too fierce , too aggressive to enjoy . He 'd tried them all , over the years . Of the other options and varieties , beer and Mead were in another camp : entirely beneath him . Those were for peasants to brew and consume in tragic nights of drunken debauchery , or for Orcs to drink in copious quantities , but Wine ... Chilled wine , especially in the hottest seasons of the years : There was a drink for the ages to admire . Its legacy held in the highest courts , the most pristine of pedigrees throughout countless Royal courts . But so perfect this nectar of the gods as it might be , wine was n't as simple a thing to obtain . The pilfered corpses of dying Kingdoms might be under his command and banner , but Orcs , undead , and Demon-spawn were terrible tenders to the grape and vine . If such a thing was possible , they seemed even worse at",Wine Harvesting was one of the few tasks of seeming normality that Gillian still took seriously.

"It was all too easy . years upon years of fighting for my life , of struggling to survive trained me , hardened me , turned me into the monster i am today . Once , a man told me that the apex predator comes about not due to its upbringing , but due to its environment forcing it to survive . for years i fought against these time travelers , their devices of death and torment etched into my mind as they hounded me , day in , day out , never granting me a moment 's rest . I fought them constantly and became stronger , more knowledgeable of what they were capable of . and more narcissistic and dismissive of the society that refused to help me , calling me crazy , despite the clear evidence surrounding me . killing one of them for the first time had been an enlightening experience , it felt great to finally take vengeance , to stop fleeing and start fighting , though i knew all too well how to flee , to change the ground of battle , despite them knowing where i would be and when . once , in my childhood i aspired to become a hero , thwarting the villains , stopping evil . what a fool i was . now ? seated upon this throne , these same `` assassins '' i 'd sent back in time to harden myself into the demon i am today surrounding me , bowing to me , not even realizing who i would inevitably become or why , I can not help but to smile cruelly . I craved this fate , craved to become the monster that dominated , that destroyed . with the world of the present and the future arrayed against me i fought back , and i proved the victor . thus writing history , not from the perspective of history , but from the seat of my own memories of how it went . history is written by the victors . and despite all odds , I now rule the world with an iron fist , and cement that rule by condemning my servants to their death at my own hands as a reward for their long servitude . I shape my past and rule the future unopposed . such is the fairness of ruling history .","For years i fought against these time travelers , their devices of death and torment etched into my mind as they hounded me.
